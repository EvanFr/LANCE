The artifacts of this work do not require any infrastructure from the authors.

Most claims (except claim 6) can be run without GPU access and with moderate to light CPU usage.

For claims 5 and 6 access to APIs for OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Gemini is required. 
In case this is not possible for the reviewer(s), the experiments are run and contain the results we got when we run them.
