It contains hidden files, an LNK file that initiates the\ninfection, and an executable file designed to unhide a decoy document while executing\nAdvanced Monitoring Agent, a remote administration tool.\nThis is the first public report about MuddyWater utilizing this remote administration tool.\nThe Multi-stage Social Engineering Campaign\n\nWhile Deep Instinct could not verify the spreading mechanism of the new campaign, it most\nlikely starts with a spear-phishing email, similar to previous campaigns.\nThe content of the email lures the victim into downloading an archive hosted at\n\u201ca.storyblok[.]com\u201d\nIn this analysis, we examine the \u201cdefense-video.zip\u201d file.\nWhen the archive is extracted, several folders must be navigated until a LNK shortcut, which\nlooks like another folder named \u201cAttachments,\u201d is found:\n\nFigure 2: LNK Shortcut\n\nHowever, there are additional hidden folders and files extracted from the archive:\n\nFigure 3: Hidden folders\n\nWhen the victim opens the LNK file, the infection chain starts.\n\n2/7\n\nBy examining the LNK file, we can see that it executes an executable from one of the hidden\ndirectories:\n\nFigure 4: LNK command line arguments\n\nThe file \u201cDiagnostic.exe\u201d has been used in both archives Deep Instinct observed. The\npurpose of this file is to execute another executable called\n\u201cWindows.Diagnostic.Document.EXE,\u201d which is located in the hidden directory named \u201c.end\u201d\nunder a \u201cWindows.Diagnostic.Document\u201d hidden directory.\nThe file named \u201cWindows.Diagnostic.Document.EXE\u201d is a signed, legitimate installer for\n\u201cAdvanced Monitoring Agent.\u201d\nIn addition to executing the remote administration tool, \u201cDiagnostic.exe\u201d also opens a new\nWindows Explorer window of the hidden \u201cDocument\u201d folder. This is done to fool the victim\nthat opened the LNK file into thinking that it was indeed a folder.\nThe decoy document is an official memo from the Israeli Civil Service Commission, which\ncan be publicly downloaded from their website.\nThe memo describes what to do in case a government worker expresses opinions against\nthe Israeli state on social networks:\n\n3/7\n\nFigure 5: Decoy document\nConclusion\n\nMuddyWater continues to attack Israeli targets in various ongoing campaigns.\nIn this campaign, MuddyWater employs updated TTPs. These include a new public hosting\nservice, employing a LNK file to initiate the infection, and utilizing intermediate malware that\nmimics the opening of a directory while executing a new remote administration tool.\n\n4/7\n\nAfter the victim has been infected, the MuddyWater operator will connect to the infected host\nusing the legitimate remote administration tool and will start doing reconnaissance on the\ntarget.\nAfter the reconnaissance phase, the operator will likely execute PowerShell code which will\ncause the infected host to beacon to a custom C2 server.\nMuddyWater has used PhonyC2 in the past. However, Deep Instinct recently observed\nMuddyWater using a new C2 framework named MuddyC2Go \u2013 a detailed blog will be\npublished soon, stay tuned.\nIOCs:\n\nFile\nMD5\n\nDescription\n\n37c3f5b3c814e2c014abc1210e8e69a2\n\nArchive containing Atera Agent\n\n16923d827a440161217fb66a04e8b40a\n\nAtera Agent Installer\n\n7568062ad4b22963f3930205d1a14df7\n\nArchive containing Atera Agent\n\n39eea24572c14910b67242a16e24b768\n\nArchive containing Atera Agent\n\n2e09e53135376258a03b7d793706b70f\n\nAtera Agent Installer\n\n1f0b9aed4b2c8d958a9b396852a62c9d\n\nArchive containing SimpleHelp\n\n065f0871b6025b8e61f35a188bca1d5c\n\nSimpleHelp Installer\n\n146cc3a1a68be349e70b79f9115c496b\n\ndefense-video.zip\n\ndd247ccd7cc3a13e1c72bb01cf3a816d\n\nAttachments.lnk\n\n8d2199fa11c6a8d95c1c2b4add70373a\n\nDiagnostic.exe\n\n04afff1465a223a806774104b652a4f0\n\nAdvanced Monitoring Agent Installer\n\n5/7\n\nMD5\n\nDescription\n\n6167f03c8b2734c20eb02d406d3ba651\n\nDecoy Document (defense-video.zip)\n\ne8f3ecc0456fcbbb029b1c27dc1faad0\n\nattachments.zip\n\n952cc4e278051e349e870aa80babc755\n\nDecoy Document (attachments.zip)\n\nNetwork\nIP or URL\n\nDescription\n\nws.onehub[.]com/files/7f9dxtt6\n\nURL to Archive of Atera\nAgent\n\na.storyblok[.]com/f/253959/x/b92ea48421/form.zip\n\nURL to Archive of Atera\nAgent\n\na.storyblok[.]com/f/255988/x/5e0186f61d/questionnaire.zip\n\nURL to Archive of Atera\nAgent\n\na.storyblok[.]com/f/259791/x/94f59e378f/questionnaire.zip\n\nURL to Archive of\nSimpleHelp\n\n146.70.149[.]61\n\nMuddyWater\u2019s SimpleHelp\nserver\n\n146.70.124[.]102\n\nSuspected MuddyWater\u2019s\nSimpleHelp server\n\n37.120.237[.]204\n\nSuspected MuddyWater\u2019s\nSimpleHelp server\n\n37.120.237[.]248\n\nSuspected MuddyWater\u2019s\nSimpleHelp server\n\na.storyblok[.]com/f/259837/x/21e6a04837/defensevideo.zip\n\nURL to Archive of Advanced\nMonitoring Agent\n\n6/7\n\nIP or URL\n\nDescription\n\na.storyblok[.]com/f/259791/x/91e2f5fa2f/attachments.zip\n\nURL to Archive of Advanced\nMonitoring Agent\n\nAdditional IOCs regarding MuddyWater can be found in our GitHub page:\nhttps://github.com/deepinstinct/Israel-Cyber-Warfare-Threat-Actors\n\n7/7",
