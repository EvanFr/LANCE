In April 2017, the Cisco Talos team disclosed the\nScarcruft group's proprietary tool, ROKRAT, a malware that has been continuously modified\nand used by the group to this day. Initially, only the Windows version of ROKRAT was used,\nbut the Android version of the malware was later identified.\nAccording to a report published by the Financial Security Institute, the Scarcruft group\nconducted an attack in mid-2017 that distributed malicious APKs to specific devices through\na watering hole attack. At the end of 2017, the group also carried out an attack campaign\ntargeting North Korean human rights organization officials and journalists from North Korean\nmedia outlets to induce the installation of malicious APKs through KakaoTalk, the most\npopular messenger in South Korea. In addition, malicious APKs were also distributed by\ncontacting targets through Facebook and uploading APKs to the Google PlayStore. The\nmalicious apps were all identified as mobile versions of ROKRAT.\nReference:\n\n2/12\n\nAccording to an analysis report published by InterLab in December 2022, during a\nconversation with a South Korean journalist via Wechat messenger, the Scarcruft group\nconvinced him to install a malicious APK file disguised as a messenger called \"Fizzle.apk\",\nsaying that he could not send sensitive files via Wechat messenger. InterLab named the\nmalicious APK \"RambleOn\", but analysis of the malicious APK revealed similarities to the\nScarcruft group's ROKRAT mobile version. Unlike in the past, the APK has the ability to\nreceive data from the attacker via a messaging service called Pushy.\nIn following the Scarcruft group's trail, Talon, S2W's threat research and intelligence center,\nidentified additional samples that perform similar functions to the published samples. They\nhave similar functionality to the malicious APKs released in 2017, but unlike in the past, the\nability to use messaging services has been added. We also found that these APKs have\nbeen continuously updated to date. S2W Talon named the malicious APKs \"Cumulus\" and\nthe plugin modules used by Cumulus \"Clugin\".\nIn this report, we further categorize the identified Cumulus by type and describe the\nattacker's TTPs and strategy based on our detailed analysis.\n\nOverview of Cumulus Types\nCumulus (aka. RambleOn) has been used by the Scarcruft APT group since at least 2019 to\ntarget Android devices. The group has been using a mobile version of the ROKRAT malware\nsince at least 2017, and S2W Talon separately classifies Cumulus as a type of existing\nROKRAT mobile malware with messaging capabilities such as FCM or Pushy added.\nCumulus is usually distributed disguised as a legitimate mobile application, such as a\nCoinMiner, image viewer, or messenger. Although we could not secure more samples, we\nhave also seen them distributed under the package names \"com.personal.info\",\n\"com.sec.mishat\", and \"com.data.person\". Based on the types of applications Cumulus\ndisguises, we suspect that it is distributed directly to individuals via messengers, such as this\nRambleOn type.\nTable 1. Types of Cumulus\nAfter obtaining additional Cumulus disguised as legitimate applications and analyzing them,\nwe were able to categorize them into three types, as shown below. Types B and C download\na separate plugin and perform their main actions in the plugin, which is why we named the\nplugin downloaded by Cumulus as Clugin.\nTable 2. Type Classification\n: Plugin that Cumulus downloads from the cloud and is responsible for information\nleakage.\n: Configuration file that a Clugin or Cumulus downloads from the cloud to execute\ncommands.\n\n3/12\n\n: An additional Dex file that the Clugin or Cumulus downloads from the cloud to perform\ncall recording functions.\nType A downloads and loads the Command file, which contains the configuration\ninformation necessary to perform the malicious behavior, and CallRecorder from the cloud.\nIt then uploads the infected device information and internal files to the cloud. It receives a\nseparate message from the attacker via FCM.\nType B downloads the Clugin from the cloud. Clugin takes over the functions of Cumlus,\ndownloads Command file and CallRecorder, steals and uploads information to the cloud.\nCompared to Type A, by introducing Clugin, Type B organizes modularization by function\nand secured stable persistence and malware update function. Same as Type A, Type B\nreceives a separate message through FCM.\nTEST seems to be used by the attacker for testing before the attack and uploads the infected\ndevice information and internal files to the cloud without downloading any additional files.\nCumulus, which is used in real-world attacks, uses abbreviations to upload each exfiltration\ndata to the cloud, but in the case of TEST, the full word is used for ease of identification\nduring the test.\nType C has most of the same features as Type B, but uploads the Device Token to the cloud\ninstead of the Firebase Database and receives messages from the attacker via Pushy.\nFCM is a service that specializes in message delivery within Firebase and was also used in\nthe mobile malware used by the Kimsuky group that we disclosed last year. The difference is\nthat the Device Token is sent to the cloud or a legitimate Firebase database, rather than to\nan attacker's C&C server. The most recent version of the Pushy service is a separate thirdparty service that provides similar functionality to FCM.\n\nTimeLine\nFigure 1. Full Timeline for Cumulus\nClugin appears to have been uploaded to Yandex Cloud and distributed since at least\nSeptember 2021. Although we do not have an exact date for the creation of Yandex Cloud,\nwe believe that Clugin distribution began around that time. The pCloud account was\nsubsequently created in October 2021, but the data exfiltration we identified was from March\n2022. Given that Type B was distributed in March 2022, we believe that the attacker began\ndistributing Clugin via pCloud in a similar way. The attacker appears to have initially\ndistributed Clugin through Yandex Cloud, and then, starting in March, configured it to\ncommunicate with pCloud on initial infection and only communicate with Yandex Cloud when\npassing a separate command. TEST is believed to be a test version to introduce this. The\nScarcruft group appears to have set the OAuth key for pCloud communication differently for\neach distributed APK but kept the OAuth key for the Yandex cloud relatively unchanged.\n\n4/12\n\n1. Behavior flow for Type A\nAfter infection, Type A registers a method to JobScheduler to periodically execute the main\nmalicious behavior. It then downloads a Command file from the Yandex cloud and steals\ninformation as specified in the Command file. It additionally downloads and loads a\nCallRecorder, which performs call recording and saves it to a file.\nThe collected infected device information and internal files are uploaded to Yandex, which\nalso transmits the device token for FCM communication, allowing the attacker to obtain the\nDevice Token of the infected device from the Yandex cloud. The attacker can use the\nobtained Device Token to send a message to the infected device via FCM, and Cumulus,\nwhich receives the message, checks whether the method that performs the malicious\nbehavior is registered in the JobScheduler and registers it if it is not.\nFigure 2. Execution flow of Type A\n\n2. Behavior flow for Type B\nCumulus in Type B downloads the Clugin from the cloud, then the Clugin downloads\nCallRecorder, and steals the infected device information and internal files. In addition, Type B\nreceives messages via FCM, adding update functions such as changing cloud storage and\nchanging OAuth Token.\nWhen executed, Type B first sends the Device Token to the Firebase Database. With the\nsent token, the attacker passes the OAuth Token and the cloud REST API through FCM,\nwhich is presumably used to download the Clugin from the cloud. At the time of analysis, we\nwere unable to obtain actual data from FCM, but based on the internal code of Type B, we\nbelieve that it is downloaded from Yandex Cloud.\nFigure 3. Execution flow of Type B\n\n3. Behavior flow for TEST\nIn the case of TEST, when the APK is executed, it steals information such as infected device\ninformation, SMS, contacts, internal files, and recordings and uploads them to the pCloud.\nAlthough TEST includes Yandex Cloud's OAuth Token, it actually uses only pCloud's OAuth\nToken initialized within the pCloud SDK class and does not use the Yandex Token. In\naddition, there is no function to send the device's Device Token separately, so we assume\nthat Type A is for testing purposes only. The string \"test-pi-d9b7e\" is used in the code to\ninitialize Firebase functionality, and the functionality is incomplete compared to other types,\nsuggesting that the attacker used this type for testing.\nFigure 4. Execution flow of TEST\n\n5/12\n\n4. Behavior flow for Type C\nType C sends messages to Cumulus via a third-party messaging service called Pushy rather\nthan FCM. Type C has both hardcoded pCloud and Yandex's OAuth Token values, and an\nattacker can update the type of cloud service and OAuth Token via Pushy.\nFigure 5. Execution flow of Type C\n\nDetailed Analysis\nWe conducted a detailed analysis of a messenger impersonation APK called \"Fizzle\" (named\nRambleOn by Interlab) and Clugin version 6.0, which is classified as Type C of Cumulus\ntypes. Below is the entire execution process of a Type C Cumulus.\nFigure 6. The communication scenario of Cumulus\n\nStage 1: Cumulus (Fizzle.apk)\n1. Status in SharedPreferences\nCumulus manages the status with SharedPreferences and references it to perform its\nmalicious behavior. The UUID or TID in the status is used as an ID to identify the infected\ndevice. Initially, it uses the UUID, but if it subsequently receives a message from the attacker\nvia Pushy, it changes the ID to the TID contained in the message instead of the UUID. Then,\nstore the Device Token for receiving messages from Pushy in PUSHYT and set CLOUD to P\nto communicate with pCloud. The OAuth Token required for cloud communication is\nspecified in PRIMARY_ACCESSTOKEN. Also, set the Clugin version to VERSION to\nrequest the Plugin{VERSION} file to the cloud, and set the download success to 1 or 0 in\nPLUGINDEXDOWN{VERSION}. CLOUD is only supported for P (pCloud) and Y (Yandex),\nand is set to P on the first run.\nTable 3. Values in status\n2. Download Clugin from Cloud\nCumulus references the status to download the Clugin in Dex form from the cloud service.\nSince the cloud identifies infected devices by their UUID or TID values, it is possible to install\na different Clugin for each device. After downloading, it calls the LogState method of the\ncom.personal.info.plugin class.\nClugin path on first run (on Cloud): /P/plugin{}\nClugin storage path (on infected device): ch.seme/Files/.temp/plugin{}.dex\nFigure 7. Downloads Clugin and invoke\n\n6/12\n\nStage 2: Clugin (DEX)\nCumulus downloads and executes Clugin in the form of plugin from the cloud. In this\nprocess, we were able to collect samples of different versions of Clugin, between 1.0 and\n6.0. After analyzing each version of the Clugin, the table below summarizes the versions and\nfeatures that we found to have noticeable changes.\nTable 4. Feature comparison table of Clugin by version\n1. Download Command file from Cloud\nThe Clugin reads the Command file from the cloud and performs information theft according\nto the values set in each field. For each field, the data is specified in the format {Type} : {Key}\n: {Value}, and the Key and Value are parsed and registered in SharedPreferences. The\nC(Command) file can be deleted from the cloud after downloading.\nCommand file download path: /{}/C\nFigure 8. Command file parsing process\nTable 5. Keys in Command file\nThe CMD in the Command file determines whether malicious behavior is performed.\nCMD == 0: Do not perform malicious behavior\nCMD > 0: Run the service and send the information after stealing it\nCMD > 10: Download and load CallRecorder\n2. Interact with Cumulus to execute malicious services\nThe Clugin checks whether the AR and SDPATH values are set in the Command file and\nexecutes the malicious behavior by interacting with Cumulus. If CMD is greater than 0 in the\nCommand file, the Clugin checks to see if a specific service in Cumulus is currently running,\nand if not, executes the service through an Intent. The service in Cumulus directly calls\nspecific methods in the Clugin to perform the actual audio recording or file collection\nbehavior. In the figure below, Clugin checks whether a service named \"com.sec.mishat.\n{ServiceName}\" is running, which is the package name of Cumulus. The reason for this\nimplementation is that the commands are modularized using Clugin, so the version of Clugin\ncan be updated at any time, taking advantage of the fact that Clugin does not depend on\nCumulus. The malicious behavior executed in this way is as follows.\nUpdate Clugin from the cloud\nAudio Record using CallRecorder\nCollect files from external storage\nFigure 9. The process of how methods are executed in Clugin\nFigure 10. Check if a specific service is running in Cumulus\n\n7/12\n\n3. Download CallRecorder\nCumulus reads the CMD from SharedPreferences and if the value is greater than 10, it\ndownloads an additional CallRecorder from the cloud that performs the call recording\nfunction and calls the CallRecorder's \"execute\" method.\nFigure 11. Downloads CallRecorder and invoke\n4. Collect & Exfiltration\nFinally, Clugin collects information from the infected device and sends it to the cloud. Here's\nwhat the data is encrypted and how stored in the cloud.\nTable 6. List of collected data and upload path\nFor the stolen items stored in the D path on the cloud, encryption is performed before\nexfiltration, which involves downloading an epk file containing the encryption key from the\ncloud. The file data is then AES decrypted and Base64 decoded with hardcoded values in\nClugin to extract the RSA public key. Each collected file is then encrypted by randomly\ngenerating an AES secret key, and the secret key is encrypted with the extracted RSA public\nkey. Finally, the encrypted file data is stored along with the encrypted AES secret key, length\nof encrypted AES secret key, Custom Path, and length of Custom Path. If the RSA public key\ndoes not exist, the generated AES secret key is stored in plain.\nSecret Key: 1qaz2wsx3edc4rfv5tgb6yhn7ujm8ik,\nIV: qwertyuiop456789\nFigure 12. Structure of the files to be stolen\nThe AES secret key and hardcoded IV value used to encrypt files are shown below.\nEncryption: AES-256-CBC\nSecret Key: Random 32byte\nIV: qwertyuiop456789\nFigure 13. Encryption flow\nFiles containing encrypted file data and additional information are named according to the\ntype of each file. Only the top two formats in the table below are actually used, and a\ncombination of UUID, cell phone number, and data type is used as the Custom Path.\nTable 7. Format of Custom path\n\nStage 3: CallRecorder\nAfter analyzing the CallRecorder that is additionally downloaded by the Clugin, we found that\nit is a DEX file that has a call recording function. CallRecorder records incoming and\noutgoing calls and saves them as separate files. The saved recording files are sent to the\n\n8/12\n\ncloud via the Clugin.\nPackage Name: com.sec.android.acservice\nFigure 14. Key features within CallRecorder\n\nActions when additional messages are received from pushy\nAn attacker can send messages to Cumulus using Pushy, a messaging service, to update\nthe status of the malware. This allows the attacker to continuously update the status of the\ninfected device. The following information can be updated via messages\n: Change the upload path for stolen information on the cloud\n: Change OAuth Token\n: Change cloud service from pCloud to Yandex\n: Update the Clugin version\n: Set app auto launch\nFigure 15. Status update\nThe flow of malicious behavior executed by Cumulus via the Pushy message service is\nshown below. In the first execution, the infected device is identified by its UUID value, but\nafter that, it is identified by its TID value.\nFigure 16. Execution flow when receiving a message from Pushy\n\nInteresting discoveries\nWe have been monitoring the group\u2019s attack campaign for a few months and have been able\nto obtain data from victims compromised by Cumulus and Clugin, as well as test data from\nattackers leaked by OPSec failures. We were able to see malicious app deployment tests\nand the context of malicious app distribution via messengers.\n\n1. Targeting Chinese Phones\nThe Scarcruft group has traditionally implemented its messaging capabilities through\nFirebase, but in the latest version, it uses a third-party service called Pushy. This is believed\nto be in case the targets use mobile devices made in China, such as Huawei. In fact, Pushy\nreviews indicate that many people have switched from Firebase to Pushy to ensure a stable\nimplementation in China.\n\n2. Installed Packages in Test Environment\n\n9/12\n\nWe found that the attacker was testing the malicious APK. From the test logs, we could see\nthe information of the attacker's test device, and from the installed application information,\nwe could see that VPN and translation applications were installed.\nAstrill VPN is used as a VPN application to bypass internet blocking in China, and SpeedCN\nis an application that increases the speed of Internet access in China. The presence of a\ntranslation application that can translate Chinese among the installed applications suggests\nthat the attacker is preparing to target Chinese-speaking users.\nTable 8. Installed packages on the test device\n\nAttribution\nOur analysis of the Cumulus and Clugin samples reveals a strong similarity in code and\nfunctionality to malicious APKs distributed by the Scarcruft group in the past through\nwatering hole attacks. The malware used was a mobile version of ROKRAT, which suggests\nthat the Scarcruft group continued to update it and use it to this day.\nReference:\nThe malicious APK used by Scarcruft in 2017 drops an additional malicious APK with the\npackage name \"com.android.systemservice\", and code similarities between the APK and\nClugin 6.0 were found. The same routine for downloading Command files from the cloud and\nregistering settings via SharedPreferences is present in both malware. We also found the\nsame values for the keys registered by the 2017 sample and those in the Command\ndownloaded by the 2023 sample.\nIn addition to this, it was found that a similar code was used to collect the same data. In\nClugin 6.0, it was added a part that collects email information from the device.\nThe package name \"com.sec.android.acservice\", which is the package name of the\nCallRecorder downloaded from the Clugin, had been used in similar samples in the past.\n\nConclusion\nWe found that the Scarcruft group has continued to improve the mobile version of the\nROKRAT malware they have been utilizing since 2017 and is still actively using it today.\nThe mobile version of the ROKRAT malware can be classified as Cumulus, which\nreceives messages from attackers via messaging services such as FCM or Pushy, and\nexfiltrates data to cloud services such as pCloud and Yandex.\nAs disclosed by Interlab, the group is conducting attack campaigns targeting individuals\nand using conversations to convince them to install malicious apps disguised as\nlegitimate apps, such as image viewers, messenger programs, etc.\n\n10/12\n\nA multi-channel strategy that utilizes cloud services such as Yandex and pCloud, as\nwell as legitimate services such as Firebase and Pushy for command and control.\n\nIoCs\nFull IoC list can be found our github\n5dde5f5fcc1ebfd932e1ef0bfcc7b272\n957ebfbd0b23a164529d7510ca89ddae\n3ae92bc233dd6a4412aa77da4dc44a19\nae767e4658a5d235ec614eaa8655da0d\nbe6f13d6e7ae5039aed46d1f8844f3ee\n0711102cbfcf18a3672a892c4ea31ad1\ne4f781e00bc48f88a717095deb78be6f\nce3104fe4184558feea707368846c226\n97856a842ff8161576fee5ad3fd0ec67\n580f22dde975ac5e3544f3a74f4a91b9\n97a750f33812195cc2add4ebd120b468\n1f2c23c7c9ecb28bfdc6627a3ad23783\n97a9ab76af215241ad2a07856b40242e\nfe11b08764fba51236325be852ca1406\na90e3bd0e2de1b6a6bec269dc0f09369\n15470bafbaf3841bac1813881e6524fa\n97ecdb46b8325a845e998cfe3bd2262e\n214ead5c75899b8d1382e558e542574a\n464df52f091f95a561474d4de62a821b\n759b26631a660d82f6a93621991c4292\n445922b01b3f8f463cb9f48d74efd9a8\n89c669739066ac655a1e2b772bb020f3\na97e22b8ca16452a4ddcb32284d7c7a7\n8092bb293352ef572464c682e81f329f\n1d4683844c8429ad141f9f66bcf29728\n27e0dcceb68c03b246874c9fcc9b744e\n72182f83e771fcaaa1e86c7c932014cb\nf58fed1e492f40d28e0bc38dc0f76b35\nd7723de89903a04b93c7a9a92d8309c2\n\nATT&CK Matrix\nCredential Access\nSteal Application Access Token (T1635)\n\n11/12\n\nPersistence\nEvent Triggered Execution (T1624)\nDiscovery\nFile and Directory Discovery (T1420)\nLocation Tracking (T1430)\nSoftware Discovery (T1418)\nSystem Information Discovery (T1426)\nCollection\nArchive Collected Data (T1532)\nAudio Capture (T1429)\nCommand and Control\nWeb Service (T1481)\nExfiltration\nExfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1639)\n\n12/12",
