This work claims that LANCE, can accurately and reliably extract and label Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from unstructured like Treat Reports.

To support this claim we demonstrate the performance of LANCE (in this case implemented with ChatGPT 4o as the underline LLM)

To implement this experiment you will need access to the OpenAI API for ChatGPT 4o.
Before running run.sh make sure you added your API key in the corresponding field at the top of the script.

In case this is not possible for the reviewer(s), we provide evaluation of the results we got running this experiment in claim 4.
The results of this experiment when run by the authors can be seen in:
