This work contributes a UI that assists the Analysts in analyzing the reports and labeling the extracted indicators.
The UI has two modes, BAP and GAP, each one used to the corresponding part of the PRISM dataset creation.

We claim that the GAP version which, unlike the BAP, provides the analysts with the proposed label and justification from LANCE, decrease the average time a junior analyst needs analyze a report by ~43% (from 242 s to 138 s).
