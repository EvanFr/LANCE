This work claims that the LANCE pipeline and prompts can generalize to other state of the art LLMs

To support this claim we compare the results we got from 4 state of the art LLMs (other than ChatGPT 4o) on the PRISM dataset.
Namely:

- Llama 3.3 70b
- Gemma 3 27b
- Nvidia Llama 3.1 Nemotron 70b
- Gemini 2.0 Flash

The evaluation of these tools is based on the results we got when we run the tools.
This is due to the fact that access to platforms like Gemini might be limited to the reviewer(s) as it requires API keys.
That being said we provide the data we used for this evaluation (the output of the LANCE pipeline with the underline LLMs) in he corresponding subdirectories of artifact/Generalization
