This work contributes a user interface (UI) specifically designed to aid analysts in analyzing threat reports for the labeling of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
The provided UI has two modes, BAP, and GAP. Each one was used for the corresponding human in the loop part of the PRISM dataset creation.

The BAP mode (pyWeb1) does not provide the LANCE generated labels or justification.
The GAP mode (pyWeb2) does provide the LANCE generated labels and justifications for each Indicator and is the one we recommend using as (as sown in the paper and the experiments also available in the artifacts) it reduces the work time of the analysts by 43% without compromising the quality of their work.


By running the run.sh file the server will start on the back end and you will be able to access the UI in your local browser.
Two reports from the PRISM dataset are already preloaded as examples.
You can load any other report as long as it has gone through the rest of the PRISM pipeline first.

You can see a detailed Analysis of the UI, the instructions given to the Analysts for each task as well as a video tutorial for the UI in /artifact/UI .
