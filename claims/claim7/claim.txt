This work claims that LANCE with ChatGPT 4o provides the highest quality indicator of compromise (IoC) ground truth compared to other prominent automated ground truth creation methods.

To support this claim we compare the results we got from 4 prominent methods on the PRISM dataset + the results we got from naively prompted ChatGPT 4o.
Namely:

- GoodFATR
- VirusTotal (+ Regular Expressions)
    - threshold 1
    - threshold 5
- AlienVault
+
- Naive GPT


The evaluation of these tools is based on the results we got when we run the tools.
This is due to the fact that access to platforms like VirusTotal, and ChatGPT 4o might be limited to the reviewer(s) as it requires API keys.
That being said we provide the data we used for this evaluation in he corresponding subdirectories of artifact/Comparison
