This work contributes PRISM, an IoC Dataset from threat reports.

This claim verifies the number of indicators in the Ground Truth dataset (GT). 

The PRISM dataset can be found in the /artifact/GT_analysis/GT.json
The Json file has the following structure:

{
    "ReportX":{
        "indicators":{
            "indicator1":{
                "type": indicator_type,
                "label": indicator_label: "IoC" or "nonIoC"
            }
            .
            .
            .
        },
        "filename": filename
    }
}

The reports are numbered from 1-50. All even reports were used for BAP and all odd reports fro GAP.

The filename corresponds to the file hash of the report as it can be found on ORKL.eu.
More information about the report as well as the text content can be found in /artifact/GT_analysis/50Reports/
