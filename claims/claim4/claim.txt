This work contributes a UI that assists the Analysts in analyzing the reports and labeling the extracted indicators.
The UI has two modes, BAP and GAP, each one used to the corresponding part of the PRISM dataset creation.

We claim that the junior analysts, when assisted by LANCE generated labels and justifications (BAP) achieve higher precision, recall, and F1 scores when labeling IoCs from unstructured threat reports.

This is seen by comparing the performance of the analysts on the reports they analyzed using the BAP mode of the UI compared to the GAP.
Given that there was no overlap of the reports used in GAP and BAP we evaluate the analysts performance on each one compare to that of LANCE with ChatGPT 4o.
We show that the performance of the analysts without the LANCE assistance is worse than LANCE while whit LANCE labels and justifications the performance of the analysts is better than LANCE.
