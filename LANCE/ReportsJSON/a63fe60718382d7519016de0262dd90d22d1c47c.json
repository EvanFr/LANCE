TAG-70 overlaps with activity reported by other security\nvendors under the aliases Winter Vivern, TA473, and UAC-0114. The group likely conducts\ncyber-espionage campaigns to serve the interests of Belarus and Russia and has been active since at\nleast December 2020, primarily targeting governments in Europe and Central Asia.\nIn their latest campaign, TAG-70 likely started exploiting Roundcube webmail servers at the beginning\nof October 2023 and continued until at least mid-October. Insikt Group detected at least 80\norganizations targeted in this campaign; the victims were primarily entities in Georgia, Poland, and\nUkraine. This campaign has been linked to additional TAG-70 activity against Uzbekistan government\nmail servers, which involved infrastructure reported by Insikt Group in February 2023.\nTAG-70\u2019s targeting of Roundcube webmail servers is only the most recent instance of targeting email\nsoftware attributed to Russia-aligned threat actor groups. In June 2023, Insikt Group discovered that\nthe Russian state-sponsored cyber-espionage group BlueDelta (APT28, Fancy Bear) was targeting\nvulnerable Roundcube installations across Ukraine and had previously exploited CVE-2023-23397, a\ncritical zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook in 2022. Other well-known Russian threat actor\ngroups, such as Sandworm and BlueBravo (APT29, Midnight Blizzard), have also previously targeted\nemail solutions in various campaigns (1, 2, 3).\nIn the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, compromised email servers may expose sensitive\ninformation regarding Ukraine\u2019s war effort and planning, its relationships and negotiations with its\npartner countries as it seeks additional military and economic assistance, expose third parties\ncooperating with the Ukrainian government privately, and reveal fissures within the coalition supporting\nUkraine. Furthermore, the targeting of the Iranian embassies in Russia and the Netherlands may be\nlinked to a desire to assess Iran's current diplomatic activities and foreign policy, especially as Russia\ncontinues to rely on Iran-provided weapons in Ukraine. Espionage against the Georgian Embassy in\nSweden and the Georgian Ministry of Defence is likely to have similar foreign policy-oriented\nmotivations, particularly as Georgia renewed its aspirations for European Union (EU) membership and\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) accession following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in early\n2022.\nOrganizations can mitigate the risk of compromise in TAG-70\u2019s Roundcube campaign by ensuring that\nRoundcube installations are patched and up-to-date, as well as by blocking and hunting for indicators\nof compromise (IoCs) in their environments (for a list of relevant IoCs, see Appendix A).\nInsikt Group followed responsible disclosure procedures in advance of this publication per Recorded\nFuture's notification policy.\n1\n\nCTA-RU-2024-0217\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nKey Findings\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\nTAG-70\u2019s espionage campaign targeted European government and military mail servers. The\ncampaign has been active since at least December 2020, primarily focusing on European and\nCentral Asian governments. TAG-70 employs advanced techniques and tools, indicating that a\nwell-funded and skilled threat actor is behind the operation.\nTAG-70 has demonstrated a high level of sophistication in its attack methods. The threat actors\nleveraged social engineering techniques and exploited cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in\nRoundcube webmail servers to gain unauthorized access to targeted mail servers, bypassing the\ndefenses of government and military organizations.\nBy infiltrating mail servers, TAG-70 aims to collect intelligence on European political and military\nactivities, possibly to gain strategic advantages or undermine European security and alliances.\nThe campaign's intended victims indicate that it has been conducted to serve the interests of\nBelarus and Russia.\nThis TAG-70 campaign has had a significant impact, as the malware may have intruded into email\nservers in multiple European countries, including Georgia, Poland, and Ukraine. Additionally,\nInsikt Group detected TAG-70 targeting Iran\u2019s embassies in Russia and the Netherlands, which is\nnotable given Iran\u2019s support of Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine. TAG-70s actions highlight the\nwidespread nature of the campaign and its implications for national security.\nTAG-70\u2019s ability to compromise mail servers poses a significant risk, as it enables the theft of\nsensitive information and manipulation of communication channels.\n\nBackground\nIn February 2023, CERT-UA reported details of TAG-70 activity in which the threat actors created a\nspoofed website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. The site lured users to download\nmalicious software for \"scanning infected PCs for viruses\".\nInsikt Group detected TAG-70 conducting website impersonation attacks in February 2023. In this\nactivity, TAG-70 appended a domain with legitimate domains of multiple Eastern European government\nwebsites to deliver script-based malware.\nIn March 2023, Proofpoint reported a new campaign in which TAG-70 exploited publicly facing Zimbra\nwebmail portals via CVE-2022-27926. This activity aimed to gain access to the emails of military,\ngovernment, and diplomatic organizations across Europe involved in the Russia-Ukraine War.\nRecorded Future highlighted TAG-70 domain registrations and suspected phishing lure material linked to\nthese domains in April 2023.\nOn October 25, 2023, ESET detailed an XSS zero-day CVE-2023-5631, used by TAG-70 to exploit\nvulnerable Roundcube webmail servers. The vulnerability enabled the attackers to list and exfiltrate\n\n2\n\nCTA-RU-2024-0217\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\ncontent from victims' mailboxes with no interaction from the victim required other than opening an\ninfected email.\n\nThreat Analysis\nBeginning March 16, 2023, Insikt Group used Recorded Future Network Intelligence to detect suspicious\nactivity from a victim IP address belonging to the Center for Economic Research and Reforms of\nUzbekistan. The victim IP address was observed communicating with the domain bugiplaysec[.]com\nover TCP port 443, which at the time resolved to IP address 176.97.66[.]57. This data was then likely\nrelayed to command and control (C2) IP address 198.50.170[.]72 on TCP port 7662. It is suspected that\nTAG-70 administered 198.50.170[.]72 via Tor, as shown in Figure 1. CERT-UA attributed the domain\nbugiplaysec[.]com to TAG-70 in February 2023.\nInsikt Group observed similar activity between an IP address registered to the Embassy of the Republic\nof Uzbekistan in Ukraine and a previously reported C2 domain, ocsp-reloads[.]com, which resolved to\nIP address 38.180.2[.]23. This additional C2 likely forwarded the data it received to IP address\n86.105.18[.]113 on TCP port 1194 and TAG-70 likely connected to the C2 via Tor, also shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: TAG-70 operational infrastructure in March 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)\n\nMalware Analysis\nOn July 27, 2023, a new TAG-70 domain, hitsbitsx[.]com, resolved to IP address 176.97.66[.]57. Insikt\nGroup also detected this domain in a JavaScript-based malware sample uploaded to a malware\nrepository, shown in Figure 2: SHA256:\nea22b3e9ecdfd06fae74483deb9ef0245aefdc72f99120ae6525c0eaf37de32e.\nThe discovered JavaScript malware matches the second-stage loader used in TAG-70\u2019s previous\nRoundcube exploitation described by ESET. This JavaScript is loaded via XSS from a malicious email\nand is used to decode a Base64-encoded JavaScript payload (jsBodyBase64). The payload is then\ninserted into the Document Object Model (DOM) of the Roundcube webpage within a newly created\n3\n\nCTA-RU-2024-0217\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nscript tag.\n\nFigure 2: Second-stage JavaScript loader (Source: Recorded Future)\n\nThe content of the JavaScript payload, jsBodyBase64, shown in Figure 3, suggests the actors were\ntargeting the Georgian Ministry of Defence domain mail[.]mod[.]gov[.]ge. The structure of this payload\noverlaps with the one described in ESET\u2019s report; however, its functionality differs: instead of exfiltrating\nthe contents of the victim\u2019s mailbox, it logs the user out of Roundcube and presents them with a new\nsign-in window. When the victim submits their credentials, their account name, username, and\npassword are sent to the C2 server, and they are then logged into Roundcube.\n\n4\n\nCTA-RU-2024-0217\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nFigure 3: Abbreviated decoded Base64 JavaScript payload containing C2 domain, victim mail server, and credential exfiltration\ncode (Source: Recorded Future)\n\nInsikt Group also identified a related JavaScript sample from November 2022: SHA256:\n6800357ec3092c56aab17720897c29bb389f70cb49223b289ea5365314199a26. This older sample\nwas hosted on the domain bugiplaysec[.]com, used the same JavaScript loader technique, and had a\nsimilar credential exfiltration payload. The content within the payload suggests that it was used to\ntarget the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, as shown in Figure 4.\n\n5\n\nCTA-RU-2024-0217\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nFigure 4: Abbreviated decoded Base64 JavaScript payload containing C2 domain, victim mail server, and credential exfiltration\ncode from JavaScript sample from November 2022 (Source: urlscan)\n\n6\n\nCTA-RU-2024-0217\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nMalicious Infrastructure Analysis\nHosting history for the domain hitsbitsx[.]com, detailed in Table 1, shows that on September 25, 2023,\nthe domain was moved from IP address 176.97.66[.]57 to IP address 38.180.3[.]57.\nIP Address\n\nDate From\n\nDate To\n\n176.97.76[.]118\n\n2023-04-12\n\n2023-07-17\n\n176.97.66[.]57\n\n2023-07-17\n\n2023-09-25\n\n38.180.3[.]57\n\n2023-09-25\n\nTable 1: Hosting history for hitsbitsx[.]com (Source: Recorded Future)\n\nAnalysis of the server banners returned from 38.180.3[.]57 showed the use of uncommon HTTP\nbanners hosted on TCP ports 80 and 443 beginning September 2023. IP address 38.180.76[.]31\nreturned the same HTTP banners (shown in Table 2) and resides on the same autonomous system,\nAS9009.\nHTTP Server Banners\n38.180.3[.]57\nPort 80\n\nPort 443\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.25.2\nDate: <REDACTED>\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 615\nLast-Modified: Tue, 15 Aug 2023 19:25:11 GMT\nConnection: keep-alive\nETag: \"64dbd117-267\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\n\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\nServer: nginx/1.25.2\nDate: <REDACTED>\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 153\nConnection: keep-alive\n\n38.180.76[.]31\nPort 80\n\nPort 443\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.25.2\nDate: <REDACTED>\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 615\nLast-Modified: Tue, 15 Aug 2023 19:25:11 GMT\nConnection: keep-alive\nETag: \"64dbd117-267\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\n\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\nServer: nginx/1.25.2\nDate: <REDACTED>\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 153\nConnection: keep-alive\n\nTable 2: Server banners from 38.180.3[.]57 and 38.180.76[.]31 (Source: Recorded Future)\n\n7\n\nCTA-RU-2024-0217\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nThe domain recsecas[.]com resolved to 38.180.76[.]31 from late September 2023 and was used in\nTAG-70\u2019s exploitation of Roundcube webmail servers, as reported by ESET in October 2023. Previously,\nin June 2023, the domain resolved to IP address 176.97.76[.]129. Historical server banners for\n176.97.76[.]129 were similar to those detailed in Table 2, with the exception that TCP port 80 was also\nreturning an HTTP 403 Forbidden page in addition to TCP port 443.\nDuring the aforementioned Roundcube campaign, TAG-70 used an infrastructure configuration similar to\nthe one detected by Recorded Future in March (Figure 1). However, Insikt Group identified a second C2\nserver within the Roundcube relay chain, which utilized TCP port 443 (as shown in Figure 5) rather than\na static high ephemeral port. As in the March campaign, Recorded Future observed TAG-70\ncommunicating with the upstream C2 via Tor to obfuscate their true location.\n\nFigure 5: TAG-70 operational infrastructure in October 2023 (Source: ESET & Recorded Future)\n\nIn this campaign, TAG-70 began exploiting Roundcube webmail servers at the beginning of October\n2023 and continued until at least mid-October. Recorded Future detected TAG-70 targeting at least 80\nseparate organizations, primarily focusing on entities in Ukraine, Georgia, and Poland, as shown in\nFigure 6.\nNotably, there were some victims outside of these countries, such as the Embassy of Iran in Moscow,\nthe Embassy of Iran in the Netherlands, and the Embassy of Georgia in Sweden.\n\n8\n\nCTA-RU-2024-0217\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nFigure 6: Geographic spread of victims of TAG-70s Roundcube exploit in October 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)\n\nTAG-70 predominantly targeted government and military webmail servers; however, the group also\ntargeted the transport and education sectors along with chemical and biological research\norganizations, as shown in Figure 7.\n\n9\n\nCTA-RU-2024-0217\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nFigure 7: Spread of victim industries targeted in TAG-70\u2019s Roundcube exploitation campaign October 2023 (Source: Recorded\nFuture)\n\nFigure 8: TAG-70\u2019s October 2023 Roundcube exploitation campaign attack flow (Source: Recorded Future)\n\n10\n\nCTA-RU-2024-0217\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nMitigations\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\nStrengthen Email Security Measures: Implement advanced email security solutions, such as\nmulti-factor authentication, encryption, and secure email gateways, to protect mail servers from\nunauthorized access and data breaches.\nConduct Regular Security Audits: Regularly audit mail servers to identify vulnerabilities,\nmisconfigurations, and potential entry points for attackers. Address any identified weaknesses\npromptly to minimize the risk of exploitation.\nEmployee Awareness Training: Provide comprehensive training on email security best practices,\nincluding identifying phishing emails, suspicious attachments, and links. Regularly reinforce\ntraining to maintain a high level of awareness and vigilance.\nImplement Network Segmentation: Separate mail servers from other critical systems by\nimplementing network segmentation. This practice limits the lateral movement of threats,\npreventing a single compromised system from compromising the entire network.\nCollaborate with Security Vendors and Intelligence Agencies: Establish partnerships with\nreputable security vendors and intelligence agencies to leverage their expertise and threat\nintelligence. Regularly exchange information on emerging threats and indicators of compromise\nto enhance proactive defense measures.\nDevelop Incident Response Plans: Create comprehensive incident response plans that outline\nclear protocols for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents. Regularly\ntest and refine these plans through simulated exercises to ensure an effective response in\nreal-world scenarios.\n\nOutlook\nThis latest campaign by Belarus and Russia-aligned TAG-70, which targets European government and\nmilitary-owned email servers, suggests a long-term strategic interest in gathering intelligence regarding\nthe war in Ukraine and the evolving foreign policies of regional powers. Belarus and Russia-aligned\ncyber-espionage groups will almost certainly continue, if not expand, targeting webmail software\nplatforms, including Roundcube, while the conflict in Ukraine continues and while tensions with the EU\nand NATO remain high.\n\n11\n\nCTA-RU-2024-0217\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nAppendix A \u2014 Indicators of Compromise\nDomains:\nbugiplaysec[.]com\nhitsbitsx[.]com\nocsp-reloads[.]com\nrecsecas[.]com\nIP Addresses:\n38.180.2[.]23\n38.180.3[.]57\n38.180.76[.]31\n86.105.18[.]113\n176.97.66[.]57\n176.97.76[.]118\n176.97.76[.]129\n198.50.170[.]72\nMalware Samples (SHA256):\n6800357ec3092c56aab17720897c29bb389f70cb49223b289ea5365314199a26\nea22b3e9ecdfd06fae74483deb9ef0245aefdc72f99120ae6525c0eaf37de32e\n\nAppendix B \u2014 MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\nTactic: Technique\n\nATT&CK Code\n\nInitial Access: Phishing\n\nT1566\n\nExecution: Exploitation for Client Execution\n\nT1203\n\nPersistence: Valid Accounts\n\nT1078\n\nCredential Access: Exploitation for Credential Access\n\nT1212\n\nCredential Access: Input Capture\n\nT1056\n\nDiscovery: File and Directory Discovery\n\nT1083\n\nCollection: Email Collection\n\nT1114\n\nCommand and Control: Non-Standard Port\n\nT1571\n\n12\n\nCTA-RU-2024-0217\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nAppendix C \u2014 Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis\n\n13\n\nCTA-RU-2024-0217\n\nRecorded Future\u00ae | www.recordedfuture.com\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nAbout Insikt Group\u00ae\nRecorded Future\u2019s Insikt Group, the company\u2019s threat research division, comprises\nanalysts and security researchers with deep government, law enforcement, military, and\nintelligence agency experience.
