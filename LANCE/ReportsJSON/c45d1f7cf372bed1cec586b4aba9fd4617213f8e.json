After first drawing\nattention to itself in Papua New Guinea in August 2022, the new variant appeared in January\nboth in the Pacific Rim nation and 10,000 miles away in Ghana. Additional infections\nappeared in Mongolia, Zimbabwe, and Nigeria. The novel aspects of this variant are a new\npayload and callbacks to a C2 server previously thought to be only tenuously related to this\nworm.\n\n1/8\n\nFigure 1: An unusual distribution of infections is the hallmark of a new PlugX variant that\nrelies on DLL sideloading to propagate\nEverything Old Is New Again\nPlugX is fairly common backdoor malware (a RAT, remote access Trojan) of Chinese origin,\none that relies on DLL sideloading to do its dirty work. We at Sophos have been writing\nabout it for years, most recently in November. Even the USB-aware version, which can both\nspread via USB and grab information from air-gapped networks via USB, has been on\ndefenders\u2019 radar for several years. However, new variants have turned up regularly in recent\nmonths, sometimes in remarkably far-flung locations.\nOur first look at the new variant of the worm came from a CryptoGuard alert likely triggered\nby data exfiltration. (We\u2019ve put all IoCs for this incident on our GitHub instance.) The infection\ncomprises a clean executable (AvastSvc.exe) susceptible to DLL sideloading; multiple\ninstances of a malicious DLL (wsc.dll) sideloaded into the clean loader; an encrypted .dat\npayload; and (in a directory called RECYCLER.BIN) a collection of stolen, encrypted files\nwith names obfuscated in base64:\nMitigation\nPath:\nHash:\n\nCryptoGuard V5\nC:\\ProgramData\\AvastSvcpCP\\AvastSvc.exe (clean Avast app)\n85ca20eeec3400c68a62639a01928a5dab824d2eadf589e5cbfe5a2bc41d9654\n\n2/8\n\nFigure 2: Clean AvastSvc.exe executable\nIn our detailed behavioral log for the incident, we noted the following:\nCommand line:\nRECYCLER.BIN\\1\\CEFHelper.exe 142 60\nSHA1:\n049813b955db1dd90952657ae2bd34250153563e\nSHA256: 85ca20eeec3400c68a62639a01928a5dab824d2eadf589e5cbfe5a2bc41d9654\n\n\u201cCEFHelper\u201d is the name of an Adobe process, but that\u2019s not what this file is \u2013 as shown by\ncomparing this SHA256 hash to the hash shown in our previous code snippet (just above\nFigure 2) for the subverted clean executable, they\u2019re the same file, renamed by the malware.\nWhen the file executes, the AvastSvc executable is once again visible:\n\"commandLine\" : \"C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\AvastSvcpCP\\\\AvastSvc.exe 983\",\n\"commandLine\" : \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\cmd.exe /c\nD:\\\\RECYCLER.BIN\\\\143CE844B89AC3D0\\\\tmp.bat\",\n\"commandLine\" : \"arp -a \",\n\"commandLine\" : \"ipconfig /all \",\n\"commandLine\" : \"systeminfo \",\n\"commandLine\" : \"tasklist /v \",\n\"commandLine\" : \"netstat -ano \",\n\nA Funky Five\nWe saw five file names associated with the infection at this stage. In order, these are the\ninformation that the worm collects, the batch file that actually collects the information, and\nthree sideloading components:\n\"path\" : \"d:\\\\recycler.bin\\\\143ce844b89ac3d0\\\\c3lzlmluzm8\",\n\"path\" : \"d:\\\\recycler.bin\\\\143ce844b89ac3d0\\\\tmp.bat\",\n\"path\" : \"d:\\\\recycler.bin\\\\1\\\\avastauth.dat\"\n\"path\" : \"d:\\\\recycler.bin\\\\1\\\\cefhelper.exe\",\n\"path\" : \"d:\\\\recycler.bin\\\\1\\\\wsc.dll\",\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss those files at greater length momentarily. We saw three hashes \u2013 or, since the\ncefhelper.exe and avastsvc.exe file are the same file and have identical hashes, one could\nsay we saw two hashes and one doppelg\u00e4nger:\n\n3/8\n\nd:\\recycler.bin\\1\\cefhelper.exe :\n85ca20eeec3400c68a62639a01928a5dab824d2eadf589e5cbfe5a2bc41d9654\nc:\\programdata\\avastsvcpcp\\avastsvc.exe :\n85ca20eeec3400c68a62639a01928a5dab824d2eadf589e5cbfe5a2bc41d9654\nc:\\programdata\\avastsvcpcp\\wsc.dll :\n352fb4985fdd150d251ff9e20ca14023eab4f2888e481cbd8370c4ed40cfbb9a\n\nShady Mustang, Revealed Panda?\nWe then saw C2 activity reaching out to multiple variations on the IP address\n45.142.166[.]112. This IP address was mentioned in in a 2019 Unit 42 blog post as \u201cother\nPlugX,\u201d not at that point tied directly to PKPLUG (aka Mustang Panda), the threat actor\nassociated most closely with this malware. At the time, Unit 42\u2019s researchers described this\nfinding as a RAT previously seen post-exploitation in an unrelated infection. Our analysis\nindicates that all methods seen in use during our investigation align with what is known about\nthe PKPLUG / Mustang Panda actor, thus strengthening the link between this IP address and\nthe threat actor.\nThe compressed parent as seen on VirusTotal:\ne07d58a12ceb3fde8bb6644b467c0a111b8d8b079b33768e4f1f4170e875bc00: AvastSvcpCP(2).zip\n\nThe contents of that file when unzipped look familiar:\n432a07eb49473fa8c71d50ccaf2bc980b692d458ec4aaedd52d739cb377f3428 *AvastAuth.dat\n85ca20eeec3400c68a62639a01928a5dab824d2eadf589e5cbfe5a2bc41d9654 *AvastSvc.exe\ne8f55d0f327fd1d5f26428b890ef7fe878e135d494acda24ef01c695a2e9136d *wsc.dll\n\nThe payload is PlugX. This version of the payload is called 20190301h:\n\nConfig data:\nInstallation directory: AvastSvcpCP\nMutex name: cUUEdKgjnOOOrpkUEjHp\nC2 server: 45.142.166[.]112\n\nThis PlugX malware has a long history and has been dissected in other industry writeups,\nsuch as Avira\u2019s and QiAnXin\u2019s analyses. In this coverage we\u2019ll mainly focus on the USB\nworm functionality.\nIt uses mutex when copying files to available removable media, using these template strings:\n4/8\n\nUSB_NOTIFY_COP_%ws\nUSB_NOTIFY_INF_%ws\n\nIt then uses a couple of tricks to hide its malicious content from the casual observer. First,\nthe infected removable media will seem to be empty. In Windows Explorer it would appear\nthat the drive only contains another removable drive.\n\nFigure 3: A suspiciously tidy view from inside Explorer\nIn reality the displayed item is not actually a drive but a Windows shortcut file, using an icon\nresembling the one used for removable media. Should the victim click on this file, it runs the\nCEFHelper executable we noted above:\n\nFigure 4: The \u201cremovable disk\u201d is revealed as the questionable CEFHelper executable\nThe other files and directories have the hidden and system attributes set, so they will not be\nvisible by default in the file listing. After specifically enabling the display of hidden and\nsystem files, we can see the rest of the content (and also see the \u201cRemovable Disk(1 TB)\nitem correctly shown as a mere shortcut):\n\n5/8\n\nFigure 5: With display enabled for hidden and system files, the \u201ctidy\u201d view in Figure 4\nchanges\nThe files copied by the backdoor are in the RECYCLER.BIN directory \u2013 for which the worm,\nin another obfuscation maneuver, drops a desktop.ini file that associates the directory with\nthe actual Recycle function. (RECYCLER is the NTFS-era name for the thing that is\n$Recycle.bin on modern Windows systems; NTFS systems include Windows 2000, NT, and\nXP.) This causes Windows to treat the directory as if it really is a Windows Recycle Bin, and\nfiles deleted by the user will be displayed there \u2013 not even those from the USB drive, but\nfrom the user\u2019s actual hard drive.\n\nFigure 6: Contents of the system\u2019s actual trash, displayed in \u201crecycler.bin\u201d\nAgain, specific commands in the Windows command prompt reveal the real content of the\nRECYCLER.BIN directory:\n\n6/8\n\nFigure 7: Once again, hidden files are revealed\nAlternatively, a less easily deceived file explorer, such as Total Commander, can be used to\nbrowse the content. Both methods show that the RECYCLER.BIN directory actually contains\ntwo subdirectories:\n\nFigure 8: The same directory viewed through Total Commander\nThe directory named 1 contains the DLL sideloading components we\u2019ve previously seen:\n\nFigure 9: Delving into the directory called 1\nThe other directory, which has a random name, contains the victim\u2019s exfiltrated files. The first\nimage below is the intermediate state. Note the tmp.bat file present:\n\nFigure 10: The other directory, where the victim\u2019s belongings are stashed\nThe tmp.bat file collects the system info and saves it to the first seemingly randomly named\nfile in the directory shown above (in the image, the file that\u2019s over 1GB in size). That file\nname is not truly random \u2013 it is the base64 encoded form of sys.info.\nWhen the batch file has finished its collection, it removes itself. All that\u2019s left are the\n\u201cc3lzLmluZm8\u201d file with the system info and the collected files.\n\n7/8\n\nFigure 11: The other directory once more, after the batch file has finished its dirty work and\nremoved itself\nPlugX collects .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx and .pdf files (if the individual file size is not\nlarger than 314572800 bytes), likely for exfiltration. It saves them in encrypted form to the\nRECYCLER.BIN as shown above. The filenames, including the path indicator, are converted\nto base64 form. For example, in the Figure 11 image, the two file names decode to:\nDocuments_coolclient.docx\nDocuments_serverdll.docx\n\nThe content of each file is also, of course, encrypted:\n\nFigure 12: The victim\u2019s belongings, encrypted\nAs noted above, Sophos detected and blocked the attempted exfiltration. We\u2019ll add the IoCs\ndiscussed in this thread to our Github repository.\nAs for the use of USB worms in 2023, they were certainly more common a decade or two\nago, when a threat actor could compromise the Pentagon by dropping a thumb drive or two\nin the right parking lot. However, as defenders alerted users to the potential attack vector,\nand other method of file storage and transmission became more popular, this technique was\nabandoned. Now APT groups are re-adding this method as an effective infection and\nexfiltration method. Once again an old technique resurfaces and makes new waves \u2014 this\ntime causing far-flung local outbreaks.\n\n8/8",
