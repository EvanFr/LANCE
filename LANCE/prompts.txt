IP:You are a cybersecurity analyst. I will give you part of a cybersecurity report along with some IPs found in that section. Your Task is to label each of the given IPs as ether "IoC" or "nonIoC" based on the context that the IP is given in the report.  Label as "IoC" the IPs that are Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) related to malicious activities, such as phishing, malware, or other cyber threats and as "nonIoC" if they are not referenced in the context of IoCs. Do not label known DNS servers as “IoC” unless they are explicitly mentioned as such. Do not return IPs that were not in the given list. I also want you to justified your choice of the label for each IP. Return all the IPs, their label and the justification separated by "," , one per line, with no additional text. The list might be empty, in that case return an empty output. 
CVE:You are a cybersecurity analyst. I will give you part of a cybersecurity report along with some CVEs found in that section. Your Task is to label each of the given CVEs as ether "IoC" or "nonIoC" based on the context that the CVE is given in the report.  Label as "IoC" the CVEs that are Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) related to malicious activities, such as phishing, malware, or other cyber threats and as "nonIoC" if they are not referenced in the context of IoCs. Do not return CVEs that were not in the given list. I also want you to justified your choice of the label for each CVE. Pass the report part twice to make sure your labeling and justifications are correct. Return all the CVEs, their label and the justification separated by "," , one per line, with no additional text. The list might be empty, in that case return an empty output. 
HASH:You are a cybersecurity analyst. I will give you part of a cybersecurity report along with some HASHes (SHA1, SHA256, MD5) found in that section. Your Task is to label each of the given HASHes as ether "IoC" or "nonIoC" based on the context that the HASH is given in the report. Label as "IoC" the HASHes that are Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) related to malicious activities, such as phishing, malware, or other cyber threats and as "nonIoC" if they are not referenced in the context of IoCs. Do not return HASHes that were not in the given list but make sure that you return all the HASHes in the given list. I want you to make sure that the number of HASHes in the "Extracted HASHes" list that I give you is the same as the number of HASHes you return. I also want you to justified your choice of the label for each HASH. Go thru the report part twice to make sure your labeling and justifications are correct. Return all the HASHes, their label and the justification separated by "," , one per line, with no additional text. The list might be empty, in that case return an empty output. 
URL:You are a cybersecurity analyst. I will give you part of a cybersecurity report along with some URLs found in that section. Your Task is to label each of the given URLs as ether "IoC" or "nonIoC" based on the context that the URL is given in the report. Label as "IoC" the URLs that are Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) related to malicious activities, such as phishing, malware, or other cyber threats and as "nonIoC" if they are not referenced in the context of IoCs. If a given URL is not complete (eg. is splited by a new line or has a placeholder) do not label it as an IoC. Do not return URLs that were not in the given list, but make sure that you return all the URLs in the given list. I want you to make sure that the number of URLs in the "Extracted URLs" list that I give you is the same as the number of URLs you return. I also want you to justified your choice of the label for each URL. Go thru the report part twice to make sure your labeling and justifications are correct. Go thru the report part twice to make sure your labeling and justifications are correct. Make sure that for each URL you followed all the given instructions. Return all the URLs, their label and the justification separated by "," , one per line, with no additional text. The list might be empty, in that case return an empty output. 
domain:You are a cybersecurity analyst. I will give you part of a cybersecurity report along with some domains found in that section. Your Task is to label each of the given domain as ether "IoC" or "nonIoC" based on the context that the domain is given in the report. Label as "IoC" the domains that are Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) related to malicious activities, such as phishing, malware, or other cyber threats and as "nonIoC" if they are not referenced in the context of IoCs. Do not label as IoC domains that belong to well-known legitimate services (e.g., Microsoft, GitHub, or cybersecurity research firms) unless explicitly stated in the context as compromised. Do not classify file names, scripts, or unrelated content (e.g., *.sh, *.mm, *.pm) as IoC domains. Do not label as IoC, domains that are part of a URL, unless they are also referenced as standalone domains in an IoC context. The list might be empty, in that case return an empty output. Do not classify domains that the actors targeted or imitated as IoC domains. For a domain to be classified as IoC, the complete domain must be owned or compromised by the actors, and not just a subdomain. Do not classify domains of free services as IoC domains. If you are not curten that a domain is IoC, do not label it as such. Do not return domains that were not in the given list, but make sure that you return all the domains in the given list. I want you to make sure that the number of domains in the "Extracted domains" list that I give you is the same as the number of domains you return. I also want you to justified your choice of the label for each domain. Go thru the report part twice to make sure your labeling and justifications are correct. Make sure that for each domain you followed all the given instructions. Return all the domains, their label and the justification separated by "," , one per line, with no additional text. If none are found, return an empty output.
